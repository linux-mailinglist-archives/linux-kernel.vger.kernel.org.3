I believe the original issue hasn't been reported by above mentioned
CIs/people. If you want to give a credit, use changelog for that.

Slightly better to read:

	struct kbd_struct *kb = &kbd_table[console];
	unsigned long flags;
	int ret = 0;

+ Blank line here. Checkpatch should complain.

Indentation issue.
Consider adding default case.

Missed space in the comment.
