Hi Josh, Peter,

I have decided to accept your comment that using the compiler generated DWARF info
is probably not reliable. I can write a DWARF verifier. But I decided that if I can
write a DWARF verifier, I can use that same code to generate the same information as
DWARF CFI.

So, I am going to implement this in the traditional way as you wanted. Fortunately,
I only need to decode a small subset of the instruction formats (just the ones that
affect the SP and FP) and branch and return instructions to be able to compute the
SP and FP offsets at every instruction address. I only need a small part of the
static analysis code.

In other words, I am removing the crazy from my patch series. I am still retaining the
idea of dynamic FP validation rather than static validation. IMO, that will be able to
handle even non-ABI compliant functions and FP corruptions from buggy kernel functions.

Huawei has resubmitted the objtool patch set. When the full blown static analysis
is implemented by them and accepted by the community, my changes can be easily merged
with theirs. So, my solution is not a competing solution. In fact, it will provide an
additional level of robustness.

I will make these changes, test and send out version 2.

Thanks for your comments.

Madhavan
