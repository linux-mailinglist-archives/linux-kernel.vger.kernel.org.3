This would be triggered easily with below code snippet in my virtual machine:

	shmid = shmget((key_t)5566, 1024 * PAGE_SIZE, 0666|IPC_CREAT);
	shm = shmat(shmid, 0, 0);
	loop {
		mbind(shm, 1024 * PAGE_SIZE, MPOL_LOCAL, mask, maxnode, 0);
		mbind(shm + 128 * PAGE_SIZE, 128 * PAGE_SIZE, MPOL_DEFAULT, mask, maxnode, 0);
	}

If there're many process doing the above work, mpol_new will be leaked easily.
So should I resend this patch with Cc stable? But it seems I'am not supposed
to make this decision and the maintainer will take care of this?

Many thanks. :)
