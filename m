HiÂ  Mike,

Your assumptions above are all correct.
TPDMs connect to the same TPDA will share the atid of the TPDA.
We have a PC tool to parse the TPDM trace data. It needs the fixed atid 
for each TPDA to identify the data.
So we configure the atid for TPDA in device tree with fixed ids.
I will discuss with internal tool team to see if TPDA's id can become 
dynamic when parse the data.

Apart from the TPDA's atid, we also have some other sources with fixed 
id in HW on our internal device.
Do you have any suggestion to how to allocate the IDs for the source 
with fixed id in HW ?

Thanks
Jinlong Mao
