I don't think anyone was doing what you describe here. My primary
point was that platforms should not implement and expose EFI reset if
that implementation fails to deal with the platform's peripherals
adequately.

Rich firmware like EFI and ACPI implies that the firmware knows how to
manage the hardware.

No, correct. This is primarily for historical reasons and for parity
with Windows/x86 which does the same (which means that on many cheap
Wintel laptops, ACPI reset is the only thing that works)

Either implement EFI reset properly, or not at all. Adding code to the
OS that forces it to reason about whether or not EFI reset can be
called safely simply means that the EFI implementation is broken and
should probably be avoided entirely.
