Yes. The capability bits default to '1', even if
CDNS_PCIE_LM_TPM_CTRL_PTMRSEN is cleared. Strictly speaking the current
behavior is wrong, and the capability bits should be cleared instead.

I believe "these bits" would have been more correct. Since these are
capability bits, the AM64* TRM lists them as read-only, but of course
they can be modified. To write them, you need to set bit [21], e.g.
you can write the PTM capability register at address 0xD200A24. At
the TRM address 0xD000A24 it is read-only.

This is correct.

I'll ask Christian for permission to resend his patch with the subject
changed.
