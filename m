Understood, and fair enough. There are 3 behavioral changes in this patch.

(a) Do not count vmpressure for mem_cgroup_resize_max() and
mem_cgroup_force_empty() in v1.
(b) Do not count vmpressure (consequently,
mem_cgroup_under_socket_pressure()) in v2 where psi is not counted
(writing to memory.max, memory.high, and memory.reclaim).

Do you want us to drop (a) and keep (b) ? or do you want to further
break down (b) to only limit the change to proactive reclaim through
memory.reclaim (IOW keep socket pressure on limit-setting although it
is not considered pressure in terms of psi) ?
