I would still prefer it in drivers/pci because I don't think
there's enough value to justify the pcie/ subdirectory.  We have
ats.c, ecam.c, iov.c, pci-pf-stub.c, and vc.c in drivers/pci even
though they're PCIe-specific.  Other files in drivers/pci like
access.c, pci-acpi.c, pci.c, probe.c, etc also have some PCIe
content.
