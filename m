In subject, I assume you mean the plural "mailboxes", not the
possessive "mailbox's".

I don't know what the convention is or will be for drivers/cxl.  In
drivers/pci, we favor "IRQ" over "irq" in English text to go along
with PCI, DOE, CDAT, etc.

Also makes "IRQs" intelligible where "irq's" looks a little funny
because the usage isn't possessive and "irqs" isn't obviously a word
or an acronym.
