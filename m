Yes, it was serious because I found the statements to be terse and open
to interpretation. Specifically, when I read it, it almost seemed that
the position is that dynamic launch is not needed, and that the kernel
could just establish its own RoT.

This clarifies the previous statements and I would say, yes, this is one
approach. Considering the challenges we have/are facing in getting a
minimal post-launch handling (sl-stub) into the setup kernel, I would be
hard-pressed to believe adding all the pre-launch handling would be
found to be acceptable. If the intent is to have it completely
self-contained, this would require,
  1) the introduction of a TPM driver into the setup kernel, a hole I
     would rather not go down again
  2) potentially the ability to load files from disk if it is not
     acceptable for the bootloader to load the DCE (ACM/SLB)
  3) miscellaneous system evaluations, memory table, machine check, etc.

The only thing that is gained from such an approach is to make dynamic
launch for Linux be self-contained in the kernel. It does not reduce the
TCB because the whole design of the dynamic launch is to provide a
controlled process that establishes a new trust chain/TCB that is
started from an untrusted state. Specifically, dynamic launch starts
with the CPU being provided all the material for the process by
untrusted code that is currently in control at the time the launch is
initiated.

With all due respect, but this is where I would have to disagree. There
is substantial benefit,
  1) a single code base that needs to be reviewed vs multiple OS
     specific versions
  2) establishes an API that decouples pre- and post-launch
  3) reduces the complexity required to enable adoption by an OS
  4) zero reduction in the security properties of the architecture

As a loyal member of the tinfoil hat brigade, I will always advocate for
accept nothing and question everything. All I can ask is to evaluate the
technical merit of the presentations [1][2][3] and the patch series [4].
If there is anything concerning with the theory or the implementation,
then it should be raised so that it may be addressed. A means to do so
is the "what if" game, as it is great to formulate a hypothesis. In this
case, the "what if" postulated is the assumption that the approach is to
allow a future MitM attack. Then the challenge is to examine the
process, their underlying mechanism, and the security properties of
those mechanisms to see if a MitM can be discerned. I will gladly engage
with anyone that presents an analysis demonstrating an assumption I
made/missed that opens the possibility for subversion of the launch
integrity attempting to be built.
