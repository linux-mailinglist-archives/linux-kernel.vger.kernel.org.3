[Problem Statement]
select_idle_cpu() might spend too much time searching for an idle CPU,
when the system is overloaded.

The following histogram is the time spent in select_idle_cpu(),
when running 224 instances of netperf on a system with 112 CPUs
per LLC domain:

The time spent in select_idle_cpu() is visible to netperf and might have a negative
impact.

[Symptom analysis]
The patch [1] from Mel Gorman has been applied to track the efficiency
of select_idle_sibling. Copy the indicators here:

SIS Search Efficiency(se_eff%):
        A ratio expressed as a percentage of runqueues scanned versus
        idle CPUs found. A 100% efficiency indicates that the target,
        prev or recent CPU of a task was idle at wakeup. The lower the
        efficiency, the more runqueues were scanned before an idle CPU
        was found.

SIS Domain Search Efficiency(dom_eff%):
        Similar, except only for the slower SIS
	patch.

SIS Fast Success Rate(fast_rate%):
        Percentage of SIS that used target, prev or
	recent CPUs.

SIS Success rate(success_rate%):
        Percentage of scans that found an idle CPU.

The test is based on Aubrey's schedtests tool, netperf, hackbench,
schbench and tbench were launched with 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150%
175% 200% of CPU number respectively. Each test lasts for 100 seconds
and repeats 3 times. The system reboots into a fresh environment for
each test.

According to the test above, if the system becomes busy, the
SIS Search Efficiency(se_eff%) drops significantly. Although some
benchmarks would finally find an idle CPU(success_rate% = 100%), it is
doubtful whether it is worth it to search the whole LLC domain.

[Proposal]
It would be ideal to have a crystal ball to answer this question:
How many CPUs must a wakeup path walk down, before it can find an idle
CPU? Many potential metrics could be used to predict the number.
One candidate is the sum of util_avg in this LLC domain. The benefit
of choosing util_avg is that it is a metric of accumulated historic
activity, which seems to be smoother than instantaneous metrics
(such as rq->nr_running). Besides, choosing the sum of util_avg
would help predict the load of the LLC domain more precisely, because
SIS_PROP uses one CPU's idle time to estimate the total LLC domain idle
time. As Peter suggested[2], the lower the util_avg is, the
more select_idle_cpu() should scan for idle CPU, and vice versa.

Introduce the quadratic function:

y = a - bx^2

x is the sum_util ratio [0, 100] of this LLC domain, and y is the percentage
of CPUs to be scanned in the LLC domain. The number of CPUs to search drops
as sum_util increases. When sum_util hits 85% or above, the scan stops.
Choosing 85% is because it is the threshold of an overloaded LLC sched group
(imbalance_pct = 117). Choosing quadratic function is because:

[1] Compared to the linear function, it scans more aggressively when the
    sum_util is low.
[2] Compared to the exponential function, it is easier to calculate.
[3] It seems that there is no accurate mapping between the sum of util_avg
    and the number of CPUs to be scanned. Use heuristic scan for now.

The steps to calculate scan_nr are as followed:
[1] scan_percent = 100 - (x/8.5)^2
    when utilization reaches 85%, scan_percent becomes 0.
[2] scan_nr = nr_llc * scan_percent / 100
[3] scan_nr = max(scan_nr, 0)

For a platform with 112 CPUs per LLC, the number of CPUs to scan is:
sum_util%   0    5   15   25  35  45  55   65   75   85 ...
scan_ns   112  112  108  103  92  80  64   47   24    0 ...

Furthermore, to minimize the overhead of calculating the metrics in
select_idle_cpu(), borrow the statistics from periodic load balance.
As mentioned by Abel, on a platform with 112 CPUs per LLC, the
sum_util calculated by periodic load balance after 112ms would decay
to about 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.7 = 8.75%, thus bringing a delay in
reflecting the latest utilization. But it is a trade-off.
Checking the util_avg in newidle load balance would be more frequent,
but it brings overhead - multiple CPUs write/read the per-LLC shared
variable and introduces cache false sharing. And Tim also mentioned
that, it is allowed to be non-optimal in terms of scheduling for the
short term variations, but if there is a long term trend in the load
behavior, the scheduler can adjust for that.

SIS_UTIL is disabled by default. When it is enabled, the select_idle_cpu()
will use the nr_scan calculated by SIS_UTIL instead of the one from
SIS_PROP. Later SIS_UTIL and SIS_PROP could be made mutually exclusive.

[Test result]

The following is the benchmark result comparison between
baseline:vanilla and compare:patched kernel. Positive compare%
indicates better performance.

Take the 224 threads as an example, the SIS search metrics changes are
illustrated below:

   5842896          +162.7%   15347978        sched_debug.cpu.sis_search.avg

There is -87.9% less CPU scans after patched, which indicates lower overhead.
Besides, with this patch applied, there is -13% less rq lock contention
in perf-profile.calltrace.cycles-pp._raw_spin_lock.raw_spin_rq_lock_nested
.try_to_wake_up.default_wake_function.woken_wake_function.
This could help explain the performance improvement - Because this patch allows
the waking task to remain on the previous CPU, rather than grabbing other CPU's
lock.

Limitations:
[1]
This patch is based on the util_avg, which is very sensitive to the CPU
frequency invariance. The util_avg would decay quite fast when the
CPU is idle, if the max frequency has been limited by the user.
Patch [3] should be applied if turbo is disabled manually on Intel
platforms.

[2]
There may be unbalanced tasks among CPUs due to CPU affinity. For example,
suppose the LLC domain is composed of 8 CPUs, and 7 tasks are bound to
CPU0~CPU6, while CPU7 is idle:

          CPU0    CPU1    CPU2    CPU3    CPU4    CPU5    CPU6    CPU7
util_avg  1024    1024    1024    1024    1024    1024    1024    0

Since the util_avg ratio is 87.5%( = 7/8 ), which is higher than 85%,
select_idle_cpu() will not scan, thus CPU7 is undetected.

A possible workaround to mitigate this problem is that the nr_scan should
be increased if idle CPUs are detected during periodic load balance. And the
problem could be mitigated by idle load balance that, CPU7 might pull some
tasks on it.

[3]
Prateek mentioned that we should scan aggressively in an LLC domain
with 16 CPUs. Because the cost to search for an idle one among 16 CPUs is
negligible. The current patch aims to propose a generic solution and only
considers the util_avg. A follow-up change could enhance the scan policy
to adjust the scan_percent according to the CPU number in LLC.

v2->v3:
 - Use 85% as the threshold again, because the CPU frequency invariance issue
   has been fixed and the patch is queued for 5.19.

 - Stop the scan if 85% is reached, rather than scanning for at least 4 CPUs.
   According to the feedback from Yicong, it might be better to stop scanning
   entirely when the LLC is overloaded.

 - Replace linear scan with quadratic function scan, to let the SIS scan
   aggressively when the LLC is not busy. Prateek mentioned there was slight
   regression from ycsb-mongodb in v2, which might be due to fewer CPUs
   scanned when the utilization is around 20%.

 - Add back the logic to stop the CPU scan even if has_idle_core is true.
   It might be a waste of time to search for an idle Core if the LLC is
   overloaded. Besides, according to the tbench result from Prateek, stop idle
   Core scan would bring extra performance improvement.

 - Provide the SIS search statistics in the commit log, based on Mel Gorman's
   patch, which is suggested by Adel.

 - Introduce SIS_UTIL sched feature rather than changing the logic of SIS_PROP
   directly, which can be reviewed easier.

v2->v1:
 - As suggested by Peter, introduce an idle CPU scan strategy that is based on
   the util_avg metric. When util_avg is very low it scans more, while when
   util_avg hits the threshold we naturally stop scanning entirely. The threshold
   has been decreased from 85% to 50%, because this is the threshold when the
   CPU is nearly 100% but with turbo disabled. At least scan for 4 CPUs even
   when the LLC is overloaded, to keep it consistent with the current logic of
   select_idle_cpu().

v1:
 - Stop scanning the idle CPU in select_idle_cpu(), if the sum of util_avg in
   the LLC domain has reached 85%.
