It should be solved by the fact that the DTPM description is a module
and loaded after the system booted. The module loading ordering is
solved by userspace.

I agree, we could improve that but it is way too complex to be addressed
in a single series and should be part of a specific change IMO.

It is really something we should be able to address later.
