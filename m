Yea we agree on that.  I've mentioned on a previous mail that whether
Qualcomm wants to support this in a generic way is questionable, since
we have no control over the firmware.  My only 'objection' is that the
kernel has a generic way of discovering which runtime services are
supported, which we will completely ignore based on some DT entries.

In any case let's find something that fits OP-TEE as well, since I can
send those patches afterwards.

As far as OP-TEE is concerned, I think we can make the 'feature'
discoverable.  I'll go propose that to op-tee but if that gets
accepted, we don't need any extra nodes (other than the existing one),
to wire up efivars_register().
