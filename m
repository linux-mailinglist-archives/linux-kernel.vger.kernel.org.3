I would like to withdraw the above statement. After looking
deeper, this is not related to the GCC bug in the above link.

I was misled by the __is_constexpr() in GENMASK_INPUT_CHECK():

| #define GENMASK_INPUT_CHECK(h, l) \
|     (BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO(__builtin_choose_expr( \
|         __is_constexpr((l) > (h)), (l) > (h), 0)))

and because of that, I was assuming that the parameters were
constant.

But actually, in the expression GENMASK(size - 1, 0), the first
member is not necessarily constant. The thing is that the warning
check occurs before the evaluation of __builtin_choose_expr() and
so, it sees the comparaison (l) > (h) and triggers the warning
even if the expression is not constant and will be eventually
discarded later.

On the contrary, for example, GENMASK(9U, 0) works fine (no
warning).

GCC man pages says:

| -Wtype-limits:
|       Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due
|       to the limited range of the data type, but do not warn
|       for constant expressions.  For example, warn if an
|       unsigned variable is compared against zero with "<"
|       or ">=".

So actually, GCC behaves exactly as expected here: emit a warning
when comparing a non-constant unsigned variable against zero.

In the particular case of GENMASK(), it is harmless, yes, but
regardless, -Wtype-limits is not broken here.

We might argue against the definition of -Wtype-limits, but I
personally think it is good as is so I will not push GCC guys to
fix what I do not consider anymore to be a bug on their side.

On GCC side, the only thing which could be changed would be to
evaluate __builtin_choose_expr() before checking for
warnings. But I doubt this is something feasible without creating
many side effects on performance.

If we refuse to modify GENMASK() or __diag_ignore() it, then all
I see left is to move -Wtype-limits to W=3.
