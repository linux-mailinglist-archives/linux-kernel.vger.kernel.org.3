Not users.  EFI firmware implementations that want to support this in
a generic way.

But that's exactly why EFI is extensible .  You can have non standard
functionality on your firmware for cases like this which doesn't need
to land in the spec.

Isn't it device dependent already?  That boat has sailed already since
we need to change the very definition of runtime services and replace
them with OS specific ones.  If we add it on the DT, you'll end up
with different DTs per OS and potentially per use case.  In my head
the DTs should be part of the firmware (and authenticated by the
firmware as well) instead of loading whatever we want each time.  By
using a config table we can add a u64 (random thought),  that tells
the kernel which TEE implementation will handle variable storage.  So
we can have a common extension to boot loaders, which at least uses
EFI interfaces to communicate the functionality.

I really prefer this to adding it on a DT, but I am not that picky.
Your email raises an important topic of replacing runtime services
with OS specific ones,  which is unfortunately very much needed and we
should fix that.
