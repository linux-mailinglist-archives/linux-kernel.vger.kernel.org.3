Hi Bjorn,

I was remiss in not mentioning our biggest actual use of specifying
this sub-subnode: to pass info to the endproint driver.  For example:

pcie@1000110000 {
        compatible = "brcm,bcm7211-pcie";
        /* ... */

        pci@0,0 {
                compatible = "pciclass,0604";
                /* ... */

                pci-ep@0,0 {
                        local-mac-address = [ 00 10 18 d0 3c 51 ];
                        reg = <0x10000 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0>;
                };
        };
};

The PCIe endpoint driver can just invoke

        of_get_mac_address(dev->dev.of_node, &addr)
