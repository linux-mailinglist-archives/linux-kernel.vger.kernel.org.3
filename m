Yes, the device becomes accessible at ~1.5s after SBR while hotplug
interrupt was re-enabled after 1s sleep. Then the hotplug event at 1.5s
was been judged as real hotplug.

I think so too, will mark it if we all aligned.

Thanks for your suggestion. I thought to enumerate all the missing
devices because SBR affects all the downstream hierarchy and
devices need to be re-enumerated as possible as we can.
I agree that we shouldn't incur any extra delays once the timeout has
already passed, since SBR fails as long as one device fails.
