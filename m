Applied to pci/p2pdma as below, thanks!

commit 1af7c26c59eb ("PCI/P2PDMA: Whitelist Intel Skylake-E Root Ports at any devfn")
Author: Shlomo Pongratz <shlomopongratz@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Apr 10 13:52:13 2022 +0300

    PCI/P2PDMA: Whitelist Intel Skylake-E Root Ports at any devfn
    
    In 7b94b53db34f ("PCI/P2PDMA: Add Intel Sky Lake-E Root Ports B, C, D to
    the whitelist"), Andrew Maier added Skylake-E 2031, 2032, and 2033 Root
    Ports to the pci_p2pdma_whitelist[], so we assume P2PDMA between devices
    below these ports works.
    
    Previously we only checked the whitelist for a device at devfn 00.0 on the
    root bus, which is often a "host bridge".  But these Skylake Root Ports may
    be at any devfn and there may be no "host bridge" device.
    
    Generalize pci_host_bridge_dev() so we check the first device on the root
    bus, whether it is devfn 00.0 or a PCIe Root Port, against the whitelist.
