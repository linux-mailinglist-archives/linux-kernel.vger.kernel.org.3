Where are we at with this?  Linus just merged my pull request, and I'd
really like to get this resolved before -rc1 (expected June 5 or so),
which means I'd like to ask him to pull the fix early next week.

The alternative is to ask him to pull these reverts, which have
actually been in -next since May 11:

  4246970a3bcb ("Revert "PCI: brcmstb: Split brcm_pcie_setup() into two funcs"")
  f35b19f02e01 ("Revert "PCI: brcmstb: Add mechanism to turn on subdev regulators"")
  ae65b283d7a4 ("Revert "PCI: brcmstb: Add control of subdevice voltage regulators"")
  d938b26e9b14 ("Revert "PCI: brcmstb: Do not turn off WOL regulators on suspend"")
