Thanks for taking the time to review my patches.

I have responded to that comment in another email. Please take a look.

This is a fair point. I will think about this a little bit and respond to this in a separate email.

So, Josh has done what you have mentioned. He has reorganized all of that code.
I am working on syncing up to his changes. I will send out version 3.

Yes. For ARM64, that is what I am trying to do. STACK_VALIDATION is optional and it
is off by default. It needs to be turned on only if reliable stack trace is required.

Please feel free to use any and all of my code. I am also looking at merging our two
decoders so that there is only one decoder. I need to think about this a little bit.
So, stay tuned.

Thanks!
