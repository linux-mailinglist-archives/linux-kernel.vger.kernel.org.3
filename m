$defs doesn't work in this case. Please see the patchlog to the v2
of this patch:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220503214638.1895-2-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/

Anyway see my next comment. Let's settle the next issue first, then
get back to the implementation details.

This series has been refactored three times already! First I created
it as the legacy bindings conversion to the yaml schema. I missed just
a few weeks, but someone has already submitted the converted bindings.
So I had to rebase my work on top of the already performed conversion.
After that you asked me to split it up into the series of patches.
Now you want the patchset to be refactored again and to be split up
again. Each such action takes a lot of my time which I've already
spent too much on this update taking into account the time spent on
looking for a way to implement the extendable array property pattern.
And there is no guaranty you won't refuse the suggested update should
I re-submit the separate patchset. So please don't ask me to split it
up again especially seeing there are only eleven DT-related patches
here. I just can't afford it, but am still very much eager to get the
work merged in in a suitable for you and me form.

Let's finally settle the main issue here so I could re-submit the
series what you'd be ok with. On each iteration you said you didn't
like the pattern I've used here. It looks like this:

1) The most common schema:
pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml:
> definitions:
>   interrupt-names:
>     oneOf:
>       - const: i1
>       - const: i2

2) Generic Dw PCIe Root Port schema:

3) Generic Dw PCIe Endpoint schema:

I am not that much happy with it either, but first I didn't find any
alternative, and second by using it I've solved several complex
problems persistent in the currently implemented DW PCIe bindings:
1) Drop the duplicated properties defined in the Root Port and Endpoint
schemas and create a common DT bindings for both of these devices
seeing in accordance with the ref. manual they are very much alike.
2) Create the generic DW PCIe Root Port and Endpoint DT-schemas with
more restrictive constraints so to stop the new drivers from creating
their own regs/clocks/resets/interrupts bindings implementation.
3) Fix the already defined DW PCIe vendor-specific DT-bindings to use
either 1) or 2) schema depending on what is applicable for them.

So to speak I was willing to bring some order to the already
implemented DT-schemas and to make sure the new bindings wouldn't
define the new names to the already known resources. As a result the
next schemas hierarchy has been provided:
                       1. Common DW PCIe schema
                       snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml
                                  |
          +-----------------------+----------------------+
          |                       |                      |
          v                       v                      V
 2.DW PCIe Root Port     3. DW PCIe Endpoint   4. DW PCIe Vendor-spec
  snps,dw-pcie.yaml     snps,dw-pcie-ep.yaml             |
          |                       |                      |
          v                       v                      V
 baikal,bt1-pcie.yaml                         hisilicon,kirin-pcie.yaml
  intel-gw-pcie.yaml                            sifive,fu740-pcie.yaml
                                              toshiba,visconti-pcie.yaml
                                            socionext,uniphier-pcie-ep.yaml
                                                 fsl,imx6q-pcie.yaml

As you can see the suggested in this patchset approach is very flexible
and permits using the common DW PCIe schema in the particular device
bindings while still have the vendor-specific constraints defined in
the particular schemas. So the new devices drivers are supposed to use
the schemas (2) and (3), while the already added drivers can
following the path (4), apply the schema (1), but still use the names
"definitions" added to (1), (2) and (3).

You keep saying that what I've done here is misleading since what was
created under the "definitions" property is perceived as the "only 1
interrupt/clock/reg/reset is supported, and you have to go look that
this is referenced from 'items'". If so then what alternative to this
solution can you suggest? Do you know a schema pattern which would be
more suitable? If there is none, then what? Do you suggest to drop
trying to solve the problems I've listed above? Please answer to these
questions (or go on on this comment for a possible but IMO less
suitable alternative solution).

Anyway in my opinion the currently implemented approach of the names
array properties:
>   reg-names:
>     items:
>       enum: [dbi, dbi2, config, atu, addr_space, link, atu_dma, appl]
isn't much more descriptive, since it doesn't provide much info
regarding the resources but just lists all the common and
vendor-specific names to the same resources.

As IMO a much less suitable, but "definitions"-less alternative to my
approach we can use the next pattern:

1) The most common schema:
pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml:
> properties:
>   interrupt-names:
>     anyOf:
>       - const: i1
>       - const: i2
>       - true

2) Generic Dw PCIe Root Port schema:
pci/snps,dw-pcie.yaml:
> allOf:
>   - $ref: /schemas/pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml#
>
> properties:
>   interrupt-names:
>     items:
>       anyOf:
>         - const: i3
>         - const: i4
>         - true

3) etc

It will give us a more generic and less restrictive bindings. Thus due
to using the "true" schema in there we won't be able to automatically
deny the new resource names adding. But it won't have any
"definitions" or "$defs" utilized as you seem do not like.
