Ok. But AFAIK, there are some of this kinds of method working as out
of tree code now. such as PPR in android etc. As I have replied to
Suren, there is always latency issue on this scheme as the agent
should poll the event/read current status/write to launch the action.
This patch is aiming at solve part of these issues.
