Thanks for diving into the history of the specification. What I learnt
about any of the specifications is that it usually has a lot of
implications that are only understandable (known) to the specification
author(s). This gives a room of misinterpretation. In any case I
usually apply my common sense denominator, so I try to go with the
straight logic. In this case it seems to me that keeping both enabled
is illogical and Linux does the right thing (means the author of the
Linux kernel implementation is on the same page with me).

Yes, we did. But why should we go this way if it already established a
special case disregarding my patch(es)? If you want to do that you
need to explain why other devices on the same chipset should enable
MSI and what's wrong with enabling MSI on the USB devices. My
understanding is that the MSI is a good thing to have due to
performance benefits and taking into account other devices that have
already been using it on the other devices of the same chipset tells
me that's okay. Moreover, the reporter of the bug confirmed that MSI
works for them after applying this quirk fix.
