Hm, but skipping the whole create_capture_mixers() call doesn't sound
right, either.  I thought there are still external mic controls via
codec, and those would be skipped by this patch?

If the mic-mute LED is the problem, it should be rather checked in the
caller of snd_hda_gen_add_micmute_led_cdev(), i.e. patch_realtek.c,
instead, IMO.
