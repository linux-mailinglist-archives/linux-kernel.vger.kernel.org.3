Why dropping or accepting is forbidden, but padding is allowed? If the
decision is no operation to the data, then padding should also be
forbidden.

If I understand right, the 2 decisions are conflicted. On one hand,
the driver should not care about the data. On another hand, the
driver should still care about the data for some rule.

So please firstly reach your agreement before making patches.

Sorry, I can't. Some clarification is needed.
