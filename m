I'd reverse the explantion in the commit and mention the securityfs
change that makes this move possible which is patch 3 in this version of
the series ("securityfs: rework dentry creation"); something like:

	Earlier we simplified how dentry creation and deletion is manged in
	securityfs. This allows us to move IMA securityfs files from global
	variables directly into ima_fs_ns_init() itself. We can now rely on
	those dentries to be cleaned up when the securityfs instance is cleaned
	when the last reference to it is dropped.
	
	Things are slightly different for the initial ima namespace. In contrast
	to non-initial ima namespaces it has pinning logic binding the lifetime
	of the securityfs superblock to created dentries. We need to keep this
	behavior to not regress userspace. Since ima never removes most of the
	securityfs files the initial securityfs instance stays pinned. This also
	means even for the initial ima namespace we don't need to keep
	references to these dentries anywhere.
	
	The ima_policy file is the exception since ima can end up removing it if
	a non-default policy is written at some point.

Last sentence should be checked for sensibility by ima folks.

Moving into imans looks good,
