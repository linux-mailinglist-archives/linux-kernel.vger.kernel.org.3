I have not played with those parameters yet, so short answer, I
am using the kernel default (above assembly was compiled with
Kbuild).  You are touching a few topics I am not familiar with, I
need some research on this before answering you in more detail.

Thanks.

For the record, fixing the -Wshadow is my real motivation. I am
pissed when the header files through some W=12 warnings.  Once
this patch is applied, there will be one last annoying W=2
warning to clear in order to only see local warnings and not
random spam from headers when doing a W=12 (at least on x86_64).

But because those kinds of W=2 fixes aren't so popular, I figured
it would be better to offer something else. I first checked if
GCC produces less optimized code than the kernel assembly: that
was still the case. I then looked at the GCC mailing list to see
if discussion on this topic existed. Didn't find it but found
instead that GCC could optimize constant expressions. And voilÃ 
how I came to the creation of this patch.

Yes, I did a quick research, the majority of the architectures already
rely on the builtin function.
Would need to give a deeper look to track if anyone else other than
x86 also uses assembly.

Also, this potentially may apply to builtin functions other than
the ffs family. Just did not find any other cases so far.

ACK. I will also follow this comment for path 2/2 and use
__variable_ffs instead of __ffs_asm_not_zero there.

I split it into multiple lines to be consistent with other macros
in the file. I have no objections to doing it on a single line (I
will just check if this is within the 80 characters limit and if
so, will do a single line in v2).

Right, I inadvertently added a space after the tab of the first
line and the editor auto indentation repeated the patterns on the
other lines.

With that said, I will prepare the v2. I will send it within two
days I think (can not do it right now).
