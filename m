Ah, so zram is really only used by the mobile stuff after all.

In the DC, I guess you don't use disk swap in conjunction with zswap,
so those writeback cache controls are less interesting to you?

But it sounds like you would benefit from the zswap(ped) counters in
memory.stat at least.

Thanks, that is enlightening!
