This would be a rhetorical question if I were not interested in the
answer but asking only to make a point.  That's not the case at all.

If these SB600 USB devices stopped working in v5.9 (October 2020),
that would affect lots of keyboards and mice, and I would be surprised
if we didn't hear about it until February, 2022.

I looked through https://github.com/linuxhw/Dmesg, and there are at
least 40 dmesg logs from v5.9 or later with SB600 USB, so I'm
still a little skeptical that 306c54d0edb6 by itself is enough to
explain this.

Anyway, I applied this to pci/msi for v5.18 with the following commit
log:

    PCI: Disable broken MSI on ATI SB600 USB adapters

    Some ATI SB600 USB adapters advertise MSI, but MSI doesn't work if INTx is
    disabled.  Disable MSI on these adapters.
