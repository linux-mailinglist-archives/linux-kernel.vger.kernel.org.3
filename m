This is also the section in the new PCIe r6.0.  Let's use that.

If FLR on an hns3 PF does *not* clear VF Enable, and the VFs still
exist after FLR, isn't that a violation of sec 9.2.2.3?

If hns3 and sec don't conform to the spec, we should have some sort of
quirk that serves to document and work around this.

What does it mean for a "transaction to be restored"?  Maybe you mean
this patch removes the *VFs* via sriov_del_vfs(), and whoever
initiated the FLR would need to re-enable VFs via pci_enable_sriov()
or something similar?

If FLR disables VFs, it seems like we should expect to have to
re-enable them if we want them.
