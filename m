The main advertised feature of this driver is PCI hotplug support.
It is the only benefit mentioned in Kconfig and the description of this commit,
so I think it was the primary motivation for writing this driver.

This driver looks unused and broken, and was designed for very old hardware.
It is probably unnecessary to keep it in the kernel as PCI hotplug is typically
not used for hardware that is so old. There are no actual problem reports, though.

If this driver will not be removed or marked BROKEN yet, I think that
PCI_CNB20LE_QUIRK could be made to depend on X86_32.
I have pretty good data that this chipset works only with 32-bit processors.
