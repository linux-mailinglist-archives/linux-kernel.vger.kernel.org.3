While AppArmor, lockdown and the integrity family use securityfs,
SELinux and Smack do not. They have their own independent filesystems.
Implementations of namespacing for each of SELinux and Smack have been
proposed, but nothing has been adopted. It would be really handy to
namespace the infrastructure rather than each individual LSM, but I
fear that's a bigger project than anyone will be taking on any time
soon. It's likely to encounter many of the same issues that I've been
dealing with for module stacking.
