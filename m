Hi Josh,

IIUC, ORC on x86 can make reliable stack unwind for this scenario
because objtool validates BP state.

I'm thinking that on arm64 there's no guarantee that LR will be pushed
onto stack. When we meet similar scenario on arm64, we should recover
(LR, FP) on pt_regs and continue to unwind the stack. And this is
reliable only after we validate (LR, FP).

So should we track LR on arm64 additionally as track BP on x86? Or can
we just treat (LR, FP) as a pair? because as I know they are always set
up together.
