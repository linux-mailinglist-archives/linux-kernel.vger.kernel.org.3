Both grab the zone lock. So as long as you'd perform the update of both
bits (PageOffline+PageBuddy) in one go under the zone lock, you could
handle it accordingly. But IIRC we don't want to accept memory while
holding the zone lock ...

Of course, you could clear the flag under the zone lock and forward the
requirement to prep_new_page(). For example, using alloc_flags.

We could have a new ALLOC_UNACCEPTED that will result in
prep_new_page()->post_alloc_hook() calling accept_page().

Relevant functions (e.g., rmqueue()) would consume *alloc_flags instead
of alloc_flags and simply clear+set the bit while updating *alloc_flags.

* __alloc_pages_bulk()->__rmqueue_pcplist() shouldn't need care because
  unaccepted pages shouldn't be on a pcp list (iow, previously
  allocated)
* Not sure if we'd have to touch try_to_compact_pages(), because we can
  only stumble over unnaccepted pages if these pages were never
  allocated, would require some thought.

So maybe it would boil down to rmqueue() only.

Fine with me, having something restricted to PageBuddy() might be
conceptually nicer, though.

Good point, do we care?
