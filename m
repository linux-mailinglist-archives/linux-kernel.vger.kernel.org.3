Great, that will help me out!  I think including the relevant DT
snippet would also make it more concrete and might conceivably be
helpful to somebody working around it on a kernel without the fix.

Ah, I see, this is the IS_ERR (but not -ENODEV) NORMAL_GET case in
_regulator_get().  You might get some emails, but I guess it must be a
fairly common situation :)

Ah, thanks!  This is the detail I missed.  If pci_host_probe()
succeeds and the link is down, we call brcm_pcie_remove() (the
driver's .remove() method).  That's unusual and possibly unique among
native host bridge drivers.  I'm not sure that's the best pattern
here.  Most drivers can't do that because they expect multiple devices
on the root bus.  And the Root Port is still a functional device on
its own, even if its link is down.  Users likely expect to see it in
lspci and manipulate it via setpci.  It may have AER logs with clues
about why the link didn't come up.

Again something for future discussion, not for this regression.

I don't really *like* comparing "busno == 1" because the root bus
number is programmable on most devices.  It would be more obvious if
we could test for a Root Port directly.  But maybe it's the best we
can do for now.

Someday it seems like we should figure out how to make the PCI core
smart enough to turn on any regulators for devices below the Root Port
when we put the Root Port in D0.  But I don't know how to do that or
even whether it's feasible.
