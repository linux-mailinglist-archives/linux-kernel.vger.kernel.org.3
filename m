Hi Keith,

IMO, the NVME driver is not associated with any device tree, Instead PCI 
driver is associated with device tree.
So unlike ACPI based platform where we have platform specific DMI 
matching, we don't have equivalent check for DT based platform.

Do we see any concern if we introduce a module param with default not 
set to quick suspend.
For platform that need full shutdown durring resume , they can set it to 
quick suspend.
