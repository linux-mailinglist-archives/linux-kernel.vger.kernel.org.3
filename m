There are two parts w.r.t setting the BAR; one is during the configuration and
the other is during the enumeration.
i) During the configuration, the size of the BAR is configured and the inbound
ATU is configured to map the BAR to a physical memory.
ii) During the enumeration, the size of the BAR is obtained and an address is
allocated and programmed in the BAR.

In the case of RC, for (i) above, the BAR size is configured as '0'
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pcie-designware-host.c#n556
and the inbound ATU is not programmed at all.

However, in the case of AM654, the HW configures BAR0 for a fixed size of 1MB
(irrespective of what SW programmed in [i]). While this was done more for a
endpoint usecase, since the same IP is configured for both RC mode and EP mode,
the fixed BAR size is seen with RC mode as well. AM654 also has MSI-X capability
for RC mode (the IP should have been ideally configured to have MSI-X capability
for EP mode). This results in PCIEPORTBUS doing some undesired access in
msix_mask_all().

Here I configure IORESOURCE_UNSET so that memory is not allocated for RC BAR.

Thank You,
Kishon
