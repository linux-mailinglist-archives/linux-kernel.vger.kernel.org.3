I don't know much about devm, but I *think* the devm things get
released by devres_release_all(), which is called by
__device_release_driver() after it calls the bus or driver's .remove()
method (pci_device_remove(), in this case).

So in this case, I think the aux dev is created after the pci_dev and
released after the PCI driver and the PCI core are done with the
pci_dev.  I assume some refcounting prevents the pci_dev from actually
being deallocated until the aux dev is done with it.

I'm not confident that this is a robust situation.

I think pci_set_master() is tied to setting PCI_DOE_CTRL_INT_EN, not
to pci_alloc_irq_vectors().
