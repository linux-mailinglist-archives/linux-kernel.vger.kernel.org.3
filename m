You can't rely on Secure Boot because compromised firmware might fail to 
implement it, so you're back to relying on dynamic trust.

I honestly feel like we're talking about different things. Can you 
describe the attack vector you're concerned about here?

The point of DRTM is that the platform (in the form of an authenticated 
code module running on the CPU, outside of the control of the OS) 
performs a measreument of a specific point in time. The policy it's 
provided with allows an external agent to identify which component of 
the runtime system is being measured. If an external malicious agent has 
been executed then the measurement will be different as a result.
