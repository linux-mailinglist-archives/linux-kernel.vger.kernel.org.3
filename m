No need to rush the versions (I see v1 on 8/9, v2 and v3 on 8/10).

But if/when you update this, capitalize the subject lines
("PCI: dwc: Add support ...") to match previous history.

s/via it's/via its/

I'm not quite sure what this sentence is saying.  I think it's
actually the *device* (not the PCIe driver) that advertises 64-bit
support in its MSI capability.

Why does this need to be exported?  CONFIG_PCIE_DW and
CONFIG_PCIE_DW_HOST are both bool, so I don't see any callers from
modules.

I see there are some other functions in pcie-designware.c that are
exported, but I'm a little dubious about those, too.  There are
several DWC drivers that are tristate (PCI_DRA7XX, PCI_EXYNOS, etc),
but they select PCIE_DW_HOST and PCIE_DW, which are bool.  I guess
this means the DWC core code gets built-in while the dra7xx, exynos,
etc code is a module.

If we want these to be modules, it would make more sense to me to have
the module include both the DWC core code and the specific driver.
I.e., the DWC core code would not be statically included at all, and
the dra7xx module would contain DWC core and dra7xx, the exynos module
would contain DWC core and exynos, etc.

Maybe Kconfig isn't expressive enough for that?  I don't know Kconfig
well enough.
