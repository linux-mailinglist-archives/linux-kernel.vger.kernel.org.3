Yes. It just says that it *can* be used to signal a device removal. It is just
an example for where it can be used. But I agree that such a use case is vague.
If it makes it better, I am fine with removing it.

Copied from sec 3.5 TDG.VP.VMCALL<SetupEventNotifyInterrupt>:

"Example of an operation that can use the event notify is the host
VMM signaling a device removal to the TD, in response to which a TD may
unload a device driver."

As per current design, If it is used for device removal, I think all registered
device drivers will get the notification and the individual device driver has
to check whether it is applicable for them.

If the SetupEventNotifyInterrupt TDVMCALL specification is extended to specify
the exact device or use case detail, then it can optimize the implementation.

Ok.

Yes. But GetQuote specification does not talk about the pooling mode
use case as well. So I think it is just a wording confusion.

Ok.

As you have explained below, as per current spec, it just expects a system
vector.

I agree that event notification is currently only used for attestation. But I
think in future there could be other use cases for it. If the intention is just
to use it for attestation, then we can just modify the GetQuote TDVMCALL to pass
the vector address, and there is no need for new TDVMCALL. I think the intention
here is to have generic method for VMM to notify TD about some events. I am not
clear about the possible future use cases, so I cannot comment on frequency of
its use.

Jun, any comments?

FWIW, this reservation is protected with CONFIG_INTEL_TDX_GUEST. So it will be
reserved only for TDX use case.
