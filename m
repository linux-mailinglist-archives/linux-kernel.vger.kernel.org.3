I agree and that is what V10 does.

This is why I reworked the handling of cur_task in those error cases.

That is what I though for V10 especially after reworking the cur_task locking.
An extra interrupt would either start processing the next task or return with
nothing to do.

As I reworked the cur_task locking I really thought about locking cur_task
throughout doe_statemachine_work().  It seems a lot safer for a lot of reasons.
Doing so would make the extra work item no big deal.

So I looked at this again because you got me worried.  If mod_delayed_work()
can cause doe_statemachine_work() while another thread is in the middle of
processing the interrupt there is a chance that signal_task_complete() is
called a second time on a given task pointer.

However, I _don't_ _think_ that can happen.  Because I don't think
mod_delayed_work() can cause the work item to run while it is already running.

So unless I misunderstand how mod_delayed_work() works we are guaranteed that
the extra interrupt will see the correct mailbox state and do the right thing.
