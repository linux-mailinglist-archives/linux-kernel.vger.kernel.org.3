I do not believe for a second that the =E2=80=9Cugly=E2=80=9D code in qu=
estion is correct. Let=E2=80=99s please not go there for TDX.  The whole=
 point of this thing is security =E2=80=94 I would rather see a somewhat=
 fragile situation than an exploit.

Now if the TD module could deliver an unrecoverable #MC instead of an im=
possible-to-handle #VE, maybe we could at least get a nice debug trace o=
ut?  Of course it=E2=80=99s not so easy to do anything with a debug trac=
e that doesn=E2=80=99t break confidentiality.

So, Dave (and other Intel folks), here=E2=80=99s a different feature I t=
hink we will want: a secure way to get debug logs out of a TDX guest. Ma=
ybe the guest could have a way to send syslog lines to the TD module (vi=
a hypercall or a ring buffer) and the TD module could encrypt them again=
st a secret that is only accessible to future boots of the same guest or=
 to an attested outside key.  TDX already has an exceedingly flexible at=
testation mechanism =E2=80=94 there is surely room for the guest config =
to include a public key that is used for encryption of exported logs.

(Yes, this is sort of doable in software, but the part where any kind of=
 buffer actually gets saved anywhere if the guest goes kaboom requires e=
ither help from the TD module or a defined protocol with key negotiation=
 involving the untrusted host.)

The model where the guest leaves a panic on the screen or serial console=
 won=E2=80=99t work in TDX=E2=80=A6
