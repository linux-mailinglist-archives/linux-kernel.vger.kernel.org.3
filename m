I'll throw my opinions in here, though a lot of this is really
about the justification for representing this via an Aux bus.
Personally I wouldn't mind if we decided the kernel was always in
charge of DOEs.  Others have a different opinion :)

Changing references to be the DOE Capability makes sense to me to me
though may be worth a one line statement that each DOE capability
provides a single mailbox interface.

Only the 'unbind' and access it directly (setpci etc) route.
These section of commentary was introduced because some people felt
we needed a standard way to do that unbind - that's one of the main
arguments in favour of using an auxbus as I understand it.

The sysfs side of things is protocol specific. We dropped the plan
to have a generic interface. It will add a device though, with basic
controls, so good to call that out here (it's mentioned in a later
patch description).

Again, was part of the requirement raised to allow unbinding of the
DOE driver. Don't need to mention specifics here though so I'd be
fine with dropping this text.

The granularity of whether to have control from a driver or not has
to be at the capability level, because we need to mediate access
to the capability, not the protocol (that may need additional mediation,
but that's a problem for whatever controls the capability).
So either the capability is in control of userspace, or it is in control
of kernel.

Agreed.

I think the description is inaccurate - the end of life is the same
as that of the PCI driver binding to the pci_dev.  It'll get cleared
up if that is unbound etc.

Thomas's recent series on enabling expanding msi-X vectors after enabling
msi-X may be useful.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20211210221642.869015045@linutronix.de/
  
But as I understand it that is still a work in progress and only applies
to MSI-X anwyay.

Perhaps we are better off just making this the callers problem and
documenting that MSI or MSI-X must be enabled and vectors requested
before we call this function.

We can just pass in INT_MAX then if we want the maximum available.

I went looking and earlier versions (pre Aux bus) made these calls in
the main driver before calling the DOE specific element.  So I don't think this came up
in previous reviews.

Good point. I think it should be both.

I can't remember what lead to that comment so hopefully moving to just
before the enable would be fine - if there was somewhere to do it.
I'm not sure there is as the IRQ enable is in the Auxilliary
Bus driver.  If we pull the pci_alloc_irq_vectors() out of here
into the caller, then the pci_set_master() should go with it.
