Right.

I agree.  I'm just not great at remembering the terminology.  I've fixed it up
in this next go round.

That was the way this series worked yest.

Nothing was added in sysfs for this series and nothing is planned in the next
series.

That said Dan and I discussed internally and have settled on the PCI layer
being agnostic to the aux bus idea.

The new PCI layer code I have simply provides helpers to create struct
pci_doe_mb (mailbox objects) which control the state machine and accept
pci_doe_tasks as work requests.

The idea of using auxiliary bus devices is now used in the CXL layer as a way
to allow individual mailboxes to be controlled via user space directly by
unlinking that auxiliary device.

I have also added a modified version of Dan's patch from here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/161663543465.1867664.5674061943008380442.stgit@dwillia2-desk3.amr.corp.intel.com/

The new version taints the kernel if a write occurs but allows any read.

I'm curious if allowing reads is really ok though.  Because allowing a read at
just the right time could allow snooping of DOE protocol data.  Could this be a
potential security issue with protocols like IDE?  It would be a difficult
attack for sure but...  :-/

The detail in this patch was that if user space unlinked a specific DOE device
then user space could control that device directly and without interference
from this kernel code.  As I stated above we will use this mechanism for CXL
but other subsystems could decide to do something else and own each DOE MB
capability directly.

We debated that and decided that was to fine a granularity.

Again, this was just more justification for the aux bus architecture.

I've clarified that thanks.  Also in the new version I've created an iterator
to find the capabilities.

Yes thanks.

No you could not.  Thus the idea that the pci_dev's lifetime was greater than
the lifetime of the auxiliary devices.

Regardless this has all changed away from being part of the core and more tied
to the management of particular devices.  Which I think is much more clear.

I've moved the call to pci_alloc_irq_vectors() to the CXL code which is
managing the pci_dev itself (rather than being buried in this auxiliary device
stuff.)

I've removed pci_msix_vec_count() in favor of counting the DOE capabilities and
allocating the vectors based on that count.

I think it was perfectly safe for this implementation but it was probably not
a good idea generally.

Is it safe to call pci_set_master() more than once?

The reason I am asking is because I've debated between having the new create
mailbox command [pci_doe_create_mb()] request the irq or not.

The issue is the irq handler is part of the DOE state machine and so
pci_request_irq() needs to pass that handler.  I would rather not make that a
globally visible function.  Nor do I think it is appropriate for the DOE state
machine to trust callers setting the correct handler.

So currently the pci_alloc_irq_vectors() is the responsibility of the consumer
(CXL layer in this series) and pci_{request,free}_irq() is handled in the PCI
layer.

But placing pci_set_master() near the DOE Interrupt Enable would then cause
pci_set_master() to be called for each mailbox create.

For now I have left the pci_set_master() call next to pci_alloc_irq_vectors()
in the CXL layer.  As in Jonathans original code it gets called if the
allocation gets enough vectors for all mailboxes found.  And the use of irq's
is all or nothing for each CXL device.

Here is the code to be more clear...
