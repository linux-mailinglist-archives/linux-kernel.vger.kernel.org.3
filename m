So in the notifier sketch I posted, I got rid of the pinning but only
for the non root user namespace use case ... which basically means only
for converted consumers of securityfs.  The last unmount of securityfs
inside the namespace now does destroy the superblock ... I checked.

The same isn't true for the last unmount of the root namespace, but
that has to be so to keep the current semantics.

Yes, that's basically what I did: pin if ns == &init_user_ns but don't
pin if not.  However, I'm still not sure I got the triggers right.  We
have to trigger the notifier call (which adds the namespaced file
entries) from context free, because that's the first place the
superblock mount is fully set up ... I can't do it in fill_super
because the mount isn't fully initialized (and the locking prevents
it).  I did manage to get the notifier for teardown triggered from
kill_super, though.
