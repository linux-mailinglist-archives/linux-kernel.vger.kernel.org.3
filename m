I think Peter's point is a little more nuanced than that. Once lazy
accept goes into the guest firmware -- without the feature negotiation
that Peter is suggesting -- cloud providers now have a bookkeeping
problem. Which images have kernels that can boot from a guest firmware
that doesn't pre-validate all the guest memory?

The way we've been solving similar bookkeeping problems up to now
(e.g., Which guest can run with CVM features like TDX/SEV enabled?
Which SEV guests can live migrate?) is as follows. We tag images with
feature tags. But this is sort of a hack. And not a great one. It's
confusing to customers, hard for the cloud service provider to
support, and easy to mess up.

It would be better if the guest FW knew whether or not the kernel it
was going to launch supported lazy accept.

That being said, this does seem like a difficult problem to solve,
since it's sort of backward from how things work, in that when the
guest firmware wants to switch between pre-validating all memory vs.
minimizing what it pre-validates, the guest kernel is not running yet!
But if there is some way to do this, it would be a huge improvement
over the current status quo of pushing the feature negotiation up to
the cloud service provider and ultimately the cloud customer.
