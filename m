I have missed this. It is hidden quite good. I thought that v2 is
completely vmpressure free. I have to admit that the effect of
mem_cgroup_under_socket_pressure is not really clear to me. Not to
mention whether it should or shouldn't be triggered for the user
triggered memory reclaim. So this would really need some explanation.

Yes it should be really limited to v1. But as I've said the effect on
mem_cgroup_under_socket_pressure is not really clear to me. It really
seems the v2 support has been introduced deliberately.
