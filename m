I would propos probably 3 patches that combined result in the following 
for enforcement of pairing. I think RSA isn't necessary to enforce since 
the OID in the signature contains the hash that was used. For SM2 I am 
not so sure about.

Subject: [PATCH] keys: asymmetric: Enforce key type and hash algo 
pairing for
  signatures

Enforce the pairing of ECRDSA with Streebog hash type, SM2 with SM3 hash,
and ECDSA with the SHA family of hashes for the low level
verify_signature() API.

Note: X509 certificates already have enforcement through the availability
of OIDs.
