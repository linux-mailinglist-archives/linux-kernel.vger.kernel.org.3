Ah right.  I must have missed his comment too.  I usually include warnings
myself, where applicable.  Let's wait for what Bjorn says, just in case, so
that we avoid adding something he does not want to have included in the
commit message.

Got it!  I run a nightly CI pipeline and been seeing complains due to the
"-Wunused-macros" show up in the log, so I decided to steal the spotlight,
so to speak, to ask about these.

Thank you for letting me know.  Appreciated!
