pci-bridge-emul.c emulates whole PCI config space and multifunction PCI
device needs to have Multi-Function Device bit set. Which
pci-bridge-emul.c does not do as it "emulates" only singe-function
device. Also some extended PCIe registers needs to be aligned for
multifunction device. And for simplification nothing from this is
implemented in that pci-bridge-emul.c driver. Basically single function
device is easily to emulate than multi function device. And for
simplicity of driver it is just better to do not implement more stuff
if it is not required.

These PCIe root ports are basically on different PCI domains, every root
port with its subtree has its own configuration, including own access
to config space of subdevices. And I do not think that there is a reason
to try putting root port (as emulated pci-to-pci bridge) on non-zero
function and putting separate root ports into "one" multifunction
device.

Technically it could be possible to implement it and also properly, as
it is just emulation of PCI device. But why? Just big complication
without any benefit. At least I do not see benefit.

Theoretically yes. But pci-aardvark is single-root-port hardware and
therefore it is single-function device. And emulated device is
registered by pci-aardvark driver, not by DT. Because it is
single-root-port HW there is no DT node for root port like for any other
single-root-port PCIe controllers. So practically no.
