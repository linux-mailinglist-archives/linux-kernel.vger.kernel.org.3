But I suppose this is the applying fixups or not issue. That's certainly 
not behavior we should rely on. If we need a way to specify applying 
fixups or not, we should do that. But really I'd prefer not to need 
that.

I still don't really like this pattern. My first read of it makes me 
think only 1 interrupt is supported, and I have to go look that this is 
referenced from 'items'.

Could we do a lot more with json-schema like you have? Yes, but the 
schemas are optimized for simplicity and a relatively fixed pattern of 
what's allowed as json-schema is new to most folks. It's also easy to 
create things that simply don't work (silently). Just reviewing this 
series is hard.

This series is trying to do lots of things. Refactoring, adding 
constraints, and adding a new binding. I would split it up if you want 
to make progress.
