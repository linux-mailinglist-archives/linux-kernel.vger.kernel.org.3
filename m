Yes, the issue is the gpio core code adds either "-gpio" or "-gpios"
itself, thus the find code does not need this. The error messages and
DT are correct. I'll reword the initial paragraph to note that which
should also deal with the other comments:

The calls to devm_gpiod_get_optional() have the -gpios at the end of
the name but the GPIO core code is already adding the suffix during
the lookup. This means the PCIe driver is not finding the necessary
reset or power lines to allow initialisation of the PCIe.

See above, it is just devm_gpiod_get_optional() parameters at fault.

Does a reword to the following make better sense:

This bug has not been noticed as if U-Boot has setup the GPIO lines
for the hardware when it does the PCIe initialisation (either by
booting from PCIe or user command to access PCIe) then the PCIe
will work in Linux. The U-Boot as supplied by SiFive does not by
default initialise any PCIe component.
