Yes, we do!

The reasoning was that in many cases a user can't do much about dying cgroups,
so it's not clear how they should/would handle getting -EAGAIN on creating a
new cgroup (retrying will not help, obviously). Live cgroups can be easily
deleted, dying cgroups - not always.

I'm not sure about switching the semantics. I'd wait till Muchun's lru page
reparenting will be landed (could be within 1-2 releases, I guess) and then we
can check whether the whole problem is mostly gone. Honestly, I think we might
need to fix few another things, but it might be not that hard (in comparison
to what we already did).
