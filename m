Yeah, that happens, still I wish it wouldn't taken *that* much longer
then what's outlined in the docs.

Side note: this and a similar issue I had today made me wonder if we
need a tag to make "this is a regression fix" more obvious to reviewers
and maintainers. But I guess that overblown; should be enough if
developers make it obvious in their cover letter or description that
this fixes a regression.
