I've updated the commit message and applied this patch, but not the other one,
as the other one wasn't actually dealing with a variable length which made it
pretty much pointless, as I mentioned.

If you'd like to look into making sparse enable this warning by default, I'd
certainly encourage you to do so.  But it looks like the warning itself could
use some more work.  It probably should only warn if the
sizeof(struct_with_flexible_array) is actually being added to another value, and
where that value is not a compile-time constant.
