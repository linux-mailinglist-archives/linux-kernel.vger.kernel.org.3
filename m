No. But this patch address something totally different. Software can do
fully valid operation, e.g. try to set forwarding memory window as large
as possible. But because this driver "emulates" pci bridge by calling
software/kernel function (mvebu_pcie_add_windows), some operations which
in real HW cannot happen, are possible in software.

For example there are limitations in sizes of forwarding memory windows,
because it is done by mvebu-mbus driver, which is responsible for
configuring mapping and forwarding of PCIe I/O and MEM windows. And due
to Marvell HW, there are restrictions which are not in PCIe HW.

Currently if such error happens, obviously kernel is not able to set
PCIe windows and it just print warnings to dmesg. Trying to access these
windows would result in the worst case in crashes.

With this change when mvebu_pcie_add_windows() function fails then into
emulated config space is put information that particular forwarding
window is disabled. I think that it is better to indicate it in config
space what is the current "reality" of hardware configuration. If window
is disabled in real-HW (meaning in mvebu-mbus driver) then show it also
in emulated config space of pci bridge.

Do you have better idea what should emulated pci bridge do, if software
try to set fully valid configuration of forwarding window, but it is not
possible to achieve it (even compliant PCI bridge must be able to do
it)?

Invalid window (limit < base) means that window is disabled. And
pci-mvebu.c in its callbacks from pci-bridge-emul.c should correctly
handle it and propagates information about disablement to mvebu-mbus
driver.

After window is valid again (limit > base) then pci-mvebu.c call
mvebu-mbus to setup new mapping.
