Yeah, that's something for which our defenses are quite weak.  But, it
also calls for a very generic mm/ solution and not something specific at
all to pkeys.

I assume that you wouldn't want to turn off *all* mmap(), MAP_FIXED or
munmap() in the process.  You just want to make one or more VMAs more or
less immutable.  That _sounds_ like a topic that would have broached at
some point in the past, although it doesn't ring any bells.

The concept would make a good lightning talk at Plumbers of LSF/MM.

That doesn't seem like it would be too much of a stretch.  There's a
delicate point when building the stack frame that the kernel would need
to move over to the new PKRU value to build the frame before it writes
the *OLD* value to the frame.  But, it's far from impossible.

I also bet we could do this with minimal new ABI.  There's already a
->ss_flags field.  We could assign a flag to mean that stack_t doesn't
end at '->ss_size' and that there's a pkey value *after* ss_size.  I do
think having a single pkey that is made accessible before signal entry
is a more flexible ABI than taking an explicit PKRU value.

I think that would allow just reusing sys_sigaltstack().
