Ok. I think this should really go through the UEFI spec process - I 
agree that from a strict interpretation of the spec, what this firmware 
is doing is legitimate, but I don't like having a situation where we 
have to depend on the DXE spec.

How does Windows handle this? Just update the page tables itself for any 
regions it needs during boot?
