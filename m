I was hoping to avoid commenting at all ;)

I'm a little bit averse to suggesting *any* command-line options
because users shouldn't have to use options like these.  It would be
better if we got a bug report and could fix the bug or add a quirk to
work around a firmware issue automatically.

If a user finds a command-line option that "works," the problem is
solved as far as they are concerned, but it doesn't help the next
person who trips over it.

I think pci_acpi_init() should warn when "acpi=noirq" was used because
the only reason to use it should be to work around a firmware defect,
and ideally, we could make a quirk to do that.  Maybe the doc should
suggest a bug report.

What does "verifying UEFI/BIOS IRQ options" mean?  I could go look at
the BIOS setup menu, but I would have no idea what to look for, so the
only thing I could do would be to try randomly changing IRQ-related
things.  If that happens to hit on a working configuration, I might
be happy, but it wouldn't help the next person at all.  I'd rather see
a bug report.  Then we could at least try to make a quirk so no
command line option would be needed.
