Thanks for that hint!

Turns out libinput has a quirk for that (ModelTabletModeNoSuspend). I'm
working with someone actually owning a SLS and we will submit an entry
to the libinput hwdb once we've fleshed that out.

I'll yet have to think some more about whether it makes sense to keep
the module parameter or not. I think ideally there would be a way to
notify user-space for more states than just tablet/laptop, but that is
very device specific.

Max
