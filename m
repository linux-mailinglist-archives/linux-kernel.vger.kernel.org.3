The existing examples are, in general, incomplete and only work for
the simplest cases.

There's 2 cases to consider here. The first is standard slots with
standard PCIe signals (e.g. PERST#) and voltage rails. The 2nd is
either non-standard slots or just soldered down devices which could
have any number of device specific resources. In the latter case,
those resources need to go into the node for the device. For the
former case (which we are discussing here), putting the resources in
the upstream (side of the link) node is fine. That's the root port
node(s) or switch port nodes. However, since most host bridges are a
single RP and don't put the RP node in DT, we've ended up with these
properties in host bridge nodes. That's fine as long as it's a single
RP and device. When it is not, we need to do something different. The
only way this scales is putting resources in the port nodes as those
are what have a 1:1 relationship to slots. If that's supported, then
the simple cases are also easily supported with if the resources are
not found in the port node/device, then look for them in the parent
node. That's also the path for how we get the handling of PERST out of
every host bridge driver.
