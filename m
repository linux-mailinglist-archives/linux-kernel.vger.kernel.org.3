Understood.

I agree that's not substantial difference. It's relevant for outer
entities "injecting" something into a subtree.
As I wrote previously, charging to the creator in the generic case is
sensible.

Are you referring to the current code (>= v5.18-rc2)? All big structs
related to mem_cgroup should be accounted. What is ignored?

Just note that memory controller may not be always enabled so
cgroup_mkdir != mem_cgroup_alloc().

Also note that (if you're purely on unified hierachy) you can protect
against that with cgroup.max.descendants and cgroup.max.depth.

Thanks,
