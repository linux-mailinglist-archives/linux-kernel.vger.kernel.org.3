This sort of device-specific behavior definitely needs a pointer to an
example.  Otherwise it seems like it could be generic PCIe behavior
that should be documented in the PCIe base spec.

Apparently nvme is broken, or at least sub-optimal, without this flag.
What other drivers will be similarly affected?
