Passing an fd around like this presumably indicates that you intend to 
let the recipient read/write to it.

Now in this example we have to assume that root is making a mistake 
passing the file descriptor around?

# ls -l /sys/kernel/security/ima/
total 0
-r--r-----. 1 root root 0 Jan 18 12:48 ascii_runtime_measurements
-r--r-----. 1 root root 0 Jan 18 12:48 binary_runtime_measurements
-rw-------. 1 root root 0 Jan 18 12:48 policy

-r--r-----. 1 root root 0 Jan 18 12:48 violations

So that's the host, right? And this is a 2nd independent example from 
the first.

Sorry, not currently following. Root is the only one being able to open 
that IMA files on the host, right? Is this a mistake here where root 
passed the fd onto the child and that child is not trusted to mess with 
the fd including passing it on further?
