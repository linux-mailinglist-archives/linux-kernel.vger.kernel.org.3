Currently both DW PCIe Root Port and End-point DT bindings are too generic
to be used as a descriptive set the device properties. Yes, it's very handy
to have them that way so the DT-schemas could be used to evaluate as many
DW PCIe-related DT-nodes as possible. But at the same time they don't
provide well defined DW PCIe RP/EP DT interface description thus leaving
too much flexibility for the new platforms, no encouraging the developers
to preserve a compatible interface.

Instead of currently implemented approach we suggest to be more
restrictive and yet preserve some level of flexibility in the DW PCIe
DT-bindings description. The device tree DT-schema is split up into
three parts: a common YAML-schema applicable for both DWC Root Port and
End-point controller configs, DWC PCIe Root Port-specific YAML-schema
and DWC PCIe End-point-specific YAML-schema, where
1) pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml - The common DT-schema describes the most
generic constraints of the "reg", "interrupts", "clocks", "resets" and
"phys" properties together with a set of common for both device types
PCIe/AXI bus properties like a maximum number of lanes or a maximum link
speed, number of inbound and outbound iATU windows. In addition to that a
set of schema definitions declared under the "$defs" property with "reg",
"interrupt", "clock" and "reset" names common for DWC PCIe Root Port and
End-point devices. They can be used by the successive DT-schemas in case
they are supposed to be compatible with the generic DWC PCIe controller
DT-bindings.
2) pci/snps,dw-pcie.yaml, pci/snps,dw-pcie-ep.yaml - generic DW PCIe Root
Port and End-point DT-bindings which aside with the device-specific
properties set also contain more restrictive constraints. All new DW PCIe
platforms are supposed to be compatible with one of these bindings by
using "allOf: " property and additionally defining their own constraints
to close up the DT-bindings set.

So to speak in case if a DW PCIe-based device for some reason has too many
specific properties or it's bindings have already been defined in a
non-generic way, it's DT-schema is supposed to include 1) YAML-file and
provide its own constraints. Otherwise the ready-to-use bindings from 2)
should be utilized. There only two DT-schemas compatible with 2) at the
moment are samsung,axynos-pcie.yaml and intel-gw-pcie.yaml. The
rest of the DW PCIe-related DT-schemas are supposed to use more generic
DW PCIe DT-bindings - pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml.

Note the provided here generic properties and their possible values are
derived from the DW PCIe RC/EP hardware manuals and from the interface
implemented in the driver. The DT-bindings schemas are created to be as
full as possible with detailed properties/names description for the
easier interface comprehension and new platforms bindings development.

Also note since there are no generic DT-nodes can be found in the kernel
dts-es which would have a pure "snps,dw-pcie" compatible string, these
DT-bindings have been created to not be selected by default for
evaluation. They are supposed to be used by the new vendor-specific
DT-schemas to at least stop adding new bindings for the same set of DWC
PCIe signals or properties.

Rob, if you comment the "select: false" line out you'll get a lot of "'*'
is not of type 'array'" errors on the dt_bindings_check command execution.
I have spend tons of time trying to figure out what was wrong, but still
failed to find out a solution. For some reason the "$ref"-ed schemas
defined under the "$defs" basic property are considered by the parser as
defining an array. No matter whether I specified the "type: string"
keyword or not, as long as there is "enum" or "oneOf" keyword used in the
"*-names" property definition in "$defs" it's considered as describing an
array thus causing the errors like:

>  DTC     Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/snps,dw-pcie.example.dt.yaml
>  CHECK   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/snps,dw-pcie.example.dt.yaml
> /.../snps,dw-pcie.example.dt.yaml: pcie@1f052000: reg-names:0: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
>        'dbi' is not of type 'array'
>        From schema: /.../snps,dw-pcie.yaml
> /.../snps,dw-pcie.example.dt.yaml: pcie@1f052000: reg-names:1: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
>         'config' is not of type 'array'
>         From schema: /.../snps,dw-pcie.yaml
> /.../snps,dw-pcie.example.dt.yaml: pcie@1f052000: interrupt-names:0: 'anyOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
>         /.../snps,dw-pcie.example.dt.yaml: pcie@1f052000: interrupt-names:0: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
>                 'msi' is not of type 'array'
>         /../snps,dw-pcie.example.dt.yaml: pcie@1f052000: interrupt-names:0: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
>                 'msi' is not of type 'array'
>         From schema: /.../snps,dw-pcie.yaml

As soon as I manually moved the same "$defs"-schemas into the places they
are referenced to, the errors disappeared and the DT-schemas validation
worked as expected by the semantics.

As I see it there must be some bug in the parser, otherwise I am out of
ideas how to implement the suggested in this patch design pattern. Rob,
could you take a look at the DT-schemas and help me out with debugging the
problem described above?
