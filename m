Hi,

After updating from kernel 5.14.11 to 5.14.14 I am seeing the following
problem:

When plugging in an USB scanner ( Brother DSMobile DS-740D ) to my
Lenovo P52 laptop I lose connection to all USB devices. Not only are
the devices no longer available on the host, but no power is drawn by
them.Â Only a reboot fixes the problem.

The scanner is the only device that triggers the problem, even when it
is the only device plugged in. I have a host of other devices,
connected either directly or via a USB hub in my monitor:

- keyboard
- mouse
- logitech brio webcam
- yubikey
- stream deck
- microphone

None of these cause any issues.
I have tried the following kernels ( packaged for openSUSE Tumbleweed
), and none of them fixed the issue:

- 5.15.2
- 5.15.5
- 5.16~rc3-1.1.ge8ae228

The problem does not appear if the scanner is connected when the laptop
is shutdown. It seems to have an init phase of about 6-7 seconds
(blinking green led) and then stays on. However, it is not detected via
lsusb or scanimage -L.

The problem does not appear on a desktop class machine ( ASUS Prime
X470-PRO/Ryzen 3700x).

The relevant parts of the kernel log seem to be:

Nov 22 11:53:18 rombert kernel: xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Abort failed to stop command ring: -110
Nov 22 11:53:18 rombert kernel: xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
Nov 22 11:53:18 rombert kernel: xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: HC died; cleaning up

I've initially reported this at
https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1192569 and CC'ed the
distribution's kernel maintainer.

Please let me know if additional information is needed.

Regards,
Robert Munteanu
