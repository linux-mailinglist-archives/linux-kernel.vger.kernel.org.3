TCG Specification(TCG PC Client Device Driver Design Principles, Section 
10), says - General control timeouts, denoted as TIMEOUT_A (A), 
TIMEOUT_B (B), TIMEOUT_C (C) and TIMEOUT_D (D), are the maximum waiting 
time from a certain control operation from the DD until the TPM shows 
the expected status change.

usleep_range(min, max) takes second parameter as max value which is same 
as maximum delay in our case. Thus the code is in compliance with the 
standard already. We still haven't heard back yet as to the reason for 
this change, nor if the problem is pervasive.

Lastly, a 12% improvement makes a difference or not depends on usecase. 
It did at least in our case.
