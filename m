This is not the case. According to the code of the preceding process,
ar->pleft and ar->pright are assigned values in ext4_ext_map_blocks.
ar->pleft is the first allocated block found to the left by map->m_lblk 
(that is, fe_logical),
and ar->pright is the first allocated block found to the right.
ar->lleft and ar->lright are logical block numbers, so there must be 
"ar->lleft < ac_o_ex.fe_logical < ar->lright".

When ac_o_ex.fe_logical is too large to overflow, predict filesize 
enters the last branch.
In this case, start = ac->ac_o_ex.fe_logical and size = ac->ac_o_ex.fe_len.
However, the overflow is checked in ext4_ext_check_overlap of 
ext4_ext_map_blocks.
The code is as follows:
```
1898         /* check for wrap through zero on extent logical start block*/
1899         if (b1 + len1 < b1) {
1900                 len1 = EXT_MAX_BLOCKS - b1;
1901                 newext->ee_len = cpu_to_le16(len1);
1902                 ret = 1;
1903         }
```
Therefore, no overflow occurs.

What codes are you referring to that can be deleted?
