 This goes back to ISA and user-supplied driver options given as kernel 
parameters, so I am fairly sure it's been a part of our user interface 
since forever.  Changing these assumptions would surely break something 
for someone out there, so I would be very wary making such changes.

 As I explained in the change description:

Yes, just bumping up PCIBIOS_MIN_IO was my first thought and the path of 
least resistance.  However with the strictly hierarchical topology of PCIe 
systems the limit of 16 ranges feels so frighteningly low to me already as 
to make me rather unwilling to reduce it even further for a system that is 
free from PC legacy junk (no southbridge let alone ISA) and therefore does 
not require it.  So I've reconsidered my initial approach and came up with 
this proposal instead.  I think it is a good compromise.
