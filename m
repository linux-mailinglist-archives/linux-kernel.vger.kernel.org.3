So while I understand why this is being proposed and clearly effort has=20
gone into it, I also think it is not the right approach. It seems this=20
proposal is to include a full PGP packet parser and verification logic=20
in the kernel as an equivalent to allow PGP signatures to be submitted=20
via FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY:

"FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY accepts a pointer to a PKCS#7 formatted detached=20
signature in DER format of the file=E2=80=99s fs-verity digest."

I may be misinterpreting, but as I understand it logic for X.509/PKCS=20
validation already exists in-kernel because of UEFI and module signing,=20
so this signature would be verified up to trusted roots. The proposal is=20
to duplicate all of this logic but in terms of PGP-formatted keys.

I believe this is unnecessary. Since it seems to require both a=20
signature and verification up to a root, and distributions like Fedora=20
already deal with x509 module signing keys for their kernel modules, I=20
can't see the merit in including the full PGP system too. The=20
least-effort approach, I would suggest, is to include an x509=20
representation of the signature in the RPM and use the existing API to=20
push that up into the kernel, with the trust anchor the same as is used=20
for module signing keys, or whatever distributions prefer (they, after=20
all, control the kernel trust anchors).

I understand this requires some effort, but so too does maintaining a=20
fully fledged PGP packet parser as privileged code for all time, and I=20
think maintaining this in userspace is a) easier and b) less costly than=20
doing it in kernel. As an added bonus, a PGP-parsing library in a=20
memory-safe language could be used in userspace.

A slightly more drastic step would be to wholesale move to PKCS=20
signatures for packaging. Linux distributions could be their own trusted=20
roots for this purpose if they so desired, and since they control=20
certificate bundles anyway they've no need to add them to the browser=20
list if that is a concern, and can issue certs without SSL Client/SSL=20
Server types and OIDs.

Probably replacing with PKCS is a non-starter, but it is at least=20
possible and it is highly likely distros package one or more tools=20
capable of validating such signatures in their base installs.

There are multiple problems with PGP that receive complaints. They are:

  1) No forward secrecy in messaging-based crypto.
  2) The data format.
  3) Outdated cryptography still supported.
  4) UX.

Of these, all four could be levelled against PKCS standards and related=20
tools too (except TLS protocols for the first point), and only 2 and 3=20
are relevant here since we are concerned with signature validation only.

I'm not "against" PGP per se, but I'm not convinced by the idea of=20
adding PGP support just for fs-verity.

I agree: whatever is chosen should in my view have decent support for=20
hardware-backed keys, because I strongly hope that is what distribution=20
key storage looks like. If not I might need to move to Gentoo.

The current RPM signing keys for Fedora are RSA-4096, which in my=20
opinion does not actually meet the bar for "good hardware support for=20
algorithm". RSA-2048 tokens are common, but 4096 much less so.

Unfortunately for this reason signify/minisign is not ideal as tools: so=20
far as I can see it has no support for hardware-backed keys. That's not=20
to say they couldn't, although they both use ed25519.

I am not sure if we'll end up in the situation where Grover's algorithm=20
is efficient but Shor is not, but this is all guesswork until we get=20
closer to a quantum computer with enough logical Qubits. But your=20
substantive point I think is valid: hardware vendors are disappointingly=20
slow at adopting edwards curves.

I think this is the wrong framing for the problem. We already have one=20
extensible system that is complicated in the kernel. This patch proposes=20
to add a second one achieving the same purpose instead of a userspace=20
solution to take advantage of the existing code, which I think would be=20
preferable and safer.
