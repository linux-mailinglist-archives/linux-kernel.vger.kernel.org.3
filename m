Based on the information given by the Intel FPGA firmware team,
CFG_READY is essential to indicate if the current FPGA 
configuration session is indeed a success. There are 
cases we test in the lab whereby, CFG_READY stays invalid and
the tests performed subsequently to verify the FPGA functionality
could not detect the failed session. A failed FPGA 
configuration session means, the new bitstream wasn't 
successfully configured and tests ran later will just be passing
on the previous working bitstream version. In short, CFG_READY
is esential, and an error indicating the time-out is a must.
Another example, using an incorrect SOF/Design FPGA results
in CFG_READY being invalid. The user must be informed of a 
potential error. 
I will correct the wordings i used earlier that says that
the timoeut error does not impact the results of the CvP
previous transactions. It may so if the firmware has some sort
of error. 

>And could you specify what the time-out mean on write_init() phase?
I could not really understand your question. We set huge 
time-outs of ~10seconds. Every wait for the firmware to respond
is potentially a hazard. The firmware CvP is has it's limitation
unfortunately.
