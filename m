This is amazing work!

Sorry if I came late, I didn't follow the threads of previous versions
so this might be redundant, I just have a couple of questions.

a) If LRU pages keep getting parented until they reach root_mem_cgroup
(assuming they can), aren't these pages effectively unaccounted at
this point or leaked? Is there protection against this?

b) Since moving charged pages between memcgs is now becoming easier by
using the APIs of obj_cgroup, I wonder if this opens the door for
future work to transfer charges to memcgs that are actually using
reparented resources. For example, let's say cgroup A reads a few
pages into page cache, and then they are no longer used by cgroup A.
cgroup B, however, is using the same pages that are currently charged
to cgroup A, so it keeps taxing cgroup A for its use. When cgroup A
dies, and these pages are reparented to A's parent, can we possibly
mark these reparented pages (maybe in the page tables somewhere) so
that next time they get accessed we recharge them to B instead
(possibly asynchronously)?
I don't have much experience about page tables but I am pretty sure
they are loaded so maybe there is no room in PTEs for something like
this, but I have always wondered about what we can do for this case
where a cgroup is consistently using memory charged to another cgroup.
Maybe when this memory is reparented is a good point in time to decide
to recharge appropriately. It would also fix the reparenty leak to
root problem (if it even exists).

Thanks again for this work and please excuse my ignorance if any part
of what I said doesn't make sense :)
