All the data from /dev/{u,}random is generated by ChaCha20, which is a 256-bit
stream cipher.  We don't target, or need to target, more than 256-bit security.
So the entropy pool itself doesn't need to be more than 256 bits, provided that
it is implemented properly using a cryptographic hash function, which it now is.
