Thanks, but on second thought, I'm not sure if this is the best way to
address the issue.

Basically, pci_power_up() is called in two places, in
pci_set_power_state() (for the transitions to D0) and in
pci_pm_default_resume_early().  In the latter case,
pci_restore_state() is called right after it and that covers BARs
restoration, so nothing more needs to be done in that case.

This means that pci_set_power_state() is the only place needing to
restore the BARs when going into D0 from D3hot or deeper and it is
better to move BARs restoration directly into it.  I'll update the
series accordingly and resend.

I also think that the mandatory delay is not needed at all when
pci_raw_set_power_state() is called for transitions D3cold -> D0,
because in that case either the device has been powered up via
platform_pci_set_power_state(), or via the bridge resume which takes
the delay into account.
