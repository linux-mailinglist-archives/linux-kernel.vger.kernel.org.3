Sounds good. Stan's acked the series now too.

Since I rebased v2 on qcom-pending (and added the missing pipe clock
patch), there shouldn't be any conflicts and the only fixup I'm aware of
is the sort order of the "qcom,pcie-ipq4019" entry in patch 8/8. 

Let me know if you prefer I fix that in a v3 otherwise these can be
applied once the MSI series has been merged.

I saw Stan acking the binding in that series, not sure if the intention
was to ack the whole series?

Right.

It appears to have been fixed in your branch now, but it hasn't yet made
it into -next.
