If a bridge has no devices behind it, it's not ever going to get into
the p2pdma code; so I'm not sure how that's relevant. And just because
one user doesn't have any device behind a bridge, doesn't mean that all
users have no devices under that bridge.

Sounds like the commit description and comments just neeed to change to
note that the function of each of the bridge is not always zero, as
originally assumed.
