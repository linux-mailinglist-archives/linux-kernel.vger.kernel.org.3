I don't have any better ideas.

That sounds right, though there are a number of other issues including SM2 being
implemented incorrectly, the "encoding" string isn't validated, and it not being
enforced that public_key_signature::pkey_algo actually matches
public_key::pkey_algo.

The hash algorithm used by fs-verity is configurable and is always returned
along with the file digest.  Currently, only SHA-256 and SHA-512 are supported.

Keep in mind that if you sign the fs-verity file digest directly with RSA,
ECDSA, or ECRDSA, the *data* you are actually signing is the fsverity_descriptor
-- the struct which the hash is a hash of.

That creates an ambiguity when full file hashes are also signed by the same key,
as I previously mentioned.  A level of indirection is needed to avoid that.

In the naive method, the *data* being signed would also be different with SM2.
The level of indirection would avoid that.
