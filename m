We have, and we added the required exceptions for the legacy platforms
that the code base supported until then. We didn't leave things broken
just because we didn't like the way things were done a long time ago.

Reverting 6dce5aa59e0b was enough for me, without changing anything
else. m400 probably uses an even older firmware (AFAIR, it was stuck
with an ancient version of u-boot that HP never updated, while Mustang
had a few updates). In any case, that DT cannot be changed.

I'm not sure people on the list are representative of all the users,
and I didn't realise the plan was "let's break everything we don't
like and see if someone wakes up" either. That definitely puts things
in a different perspective.
