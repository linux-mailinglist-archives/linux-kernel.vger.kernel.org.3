This sounds very similar to what Qualcomm may be doing on some devices.
The TrEE interface allows for callbacks and there are indications that
one such callback-service is for RPMB. I believe that at least on some
platforms, Qualcomm also stores UEFI variables in RPMB and uses the same
uefisecapp interface in combination with RPMB listeners installed by the
kernel to access them.

I would very much like to avoid the need for special bootloaders. The
devices we're talking about are WoA devices, meaning they _should_
ideally boot just fine with EFI and ACPI.

 From an end-user perspective, it's annoying enough that we'll have to
stick with DTs for the time being due to the use of PEPs in ACPI. I
really don't want to add some special bootloader for fixups to that.
Also, this would just move the problem from kernel to bootloader.

If you have any suggestions for another way of detecting this, please
feel free to share. I, unfortunately, don't.

Regards,
Max
