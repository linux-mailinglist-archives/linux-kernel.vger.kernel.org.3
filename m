We have put slot stuff in the bridge node. That's because PCI child 
nodes already have a definition and we didn't define slot nodes up 
front. We often have started without a slot/connector and then 
retrofitted nodes in.

I can think of lots of ways to implement 'slot power' with a single GPIO 
being just one way. If it's not defined by PCIe specs or defacto 
standards then I don't think we want to try to do something generic.

The other way to model power gpios is as a GPIO regulator. We probably 
already have PCI examples doing that.

A GPIO regulator solves this problem as it is reference counted.

Can it detect a card insertion when powered down?

I think a GPIO regulator solves all this as long as card detect still 
works.

I'm not either. I know there's some backlog of work to rework PCI power 
management to be more inline with how the rest of kernel drivers work.
 
Isn't D3cold an ACPI thing, not PCI?
