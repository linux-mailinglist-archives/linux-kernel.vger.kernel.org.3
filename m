Hi Ulf,

1. I've found the reason. If we only enable REQ_FUA, there won't be any 
effect -- The block layer won't send any request with FUA flag to the 
driver.
If we want REQ_FUA to take effect, we must enable REQ_FLUSH. But on the 
contrary, REQ_FLUSH does not rely on REQ_FUA.
In the previous patch(commit f4c5522b0a88 ("mmc: Reliable write 
support.")), REQ_FLUSH was added to make REQ_FUA effective. I've done 
experiments to prove this.

2. Why block layer requires REQ_FLUSH to make REQ_FUA effective? I did 
not find the reason. Does anyone know about this? Thank you.

Dear Ulf, Sorry for the delay. I was trying to figure out the SD cache 
stuff, so a few day was taken...
