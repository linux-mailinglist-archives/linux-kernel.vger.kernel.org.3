Well, I don't think so. Because slow disks don't tend to do a lot of
internal scheduling (or have deep IO queues for that matter). Also note
that generally bfq_select_queue() will not even expire a queue (despite it
not having any requests to dispatch) when we should not dispatch other
requests to maintain service guarantees. So I think service guarantees will
be generally preserved. Obviously I could be wrong, we we will not know
until we try it :).
