Right. I should, but I would do that in a more generic way. Please see

Thanks for clarification. I should have investigated the problem more
thoroughly. Now I see what was the reason of that change.  It was
indeed wrong to blame the commit c2b0c098fbd1 ("PCI: dwc: Use generic
config accessors") that something was done incorrectly. After a more
thorough commit inspection I realized that you just replaced the
dw_pcie_rd_own_conf() and dw_pcie_wr_own_conf() with the generic
pci_generic_config_read and pci_generic_config_write() as they had
been equivalent anyway.  I thought they didn't have the same semantic
by confusing the dw_pcie_{read,write}() and dw_pcie_{read,write}_dbi()
methods usage (see the _dbi suffix) in the original own PCI
config-space accessors. So to speak I'll need to drop the Fixes tag
with your commit hash from the patch.

Getting back to the own-bus accessors. DW PCIe RP/EP own-config space
is accessed over the DBI-bus. If the particular platform is designed
in a way so the DBI MMIO space access has some non-specific
peculiarities then that platform implements its own read_dbi/write_dbi
accessors. In case if these callbacks are defined, the driver must
use them for all DBI MMIO accesses including for the ones performed
from the subsystem core in the framework of the host own config-space
setups. As I mentioned in the patch log currently the only platforms
with such requirement happen to be Histb, Exynos and Kirin DW PCIe. As
such we can freely get back the generic dw_pcie_rd_own_conf() and
dw_pcie_wr_own_conf() methods but use the dw_pcie_{read,write}_dbi()
methods in there in the same way as it is done in the Histb, Exynos
and Kirin DW PCIe drivers (see their own PCI config-space accessors
match). Due to that we can drop the pci_ops redefinition from these
platforms and just use the own-config space accessors for all such
platforms as it's suggested in this patch. So this modification can be
re-qualified to the cleanup one then:
1) Create the generic own config-space accessors (more portable as
the DBI-bus access specifics must be always taken into account) as it
is suggested in this patch already.
2) Drop the Kirin, Exynos, Histb own config-space re-definition.
3) Drop the dw_pcie_read_dbi() and dw_pcie_write_dbi() methods exporting.

What do you think?
