You won't get the stack backtrace information without page_owner 
enabled. I believe that is a helpful piece of information. I don't 
expect page_owner to be enabled by default on production system because 
of its memory overhead.

I believe you can actually see the number of memory cgroups present by 
looking at the /proc/cgroups file. Though, you don't know how many of 
them are offline memcgs. So if one suspect that there are a large number 
of offline memcgs, one can set up a test environment with page_owner 
enabled for further analysis.

Cheers,
Longman
