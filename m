I will change the description for 'reg' and 'op-mode'.

Will add minimum and maximum. Should this be added as a conditional
property when op-mode is 0 (I2S mode) and mark it as required?

Okay. Will remove it.

Will mention this in the description of both tx/rx-num-evt.

Specific properties are not marked for the port. So it should not be an
issue. Other alternative is to mark the additional properties as true
but that is not preferred.

Peter,
Any other changes I should make?
