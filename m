The hardware is designed to use 4 DMA buffers and fill the buffer with the
traced data one by one. When one buffer is full the device will notify the
driver by interrupt and continue to trace the PCIe TLPs in the following
buffer without pausing. If the interrupt status bit of the buffer going to
use is uncleared, the trace will be paused until the corresponding interrupt
status bit is cleared. So the buffer size of 4 MiB is calculated that even
at the max flow the driver can handle the traced data and clear the status
in time, so there won't be a data loss.

For the first thing, the performance is acceptable as we only handle 4MiB at
one time. It's in thread context so we won't block others. The hardware can
keep tracing in the following DMA buffer so handling here won't pause the
trace and will not cause data loss.

For the second thing, this function is called in 2 places: 1) in the IRQ thread
2) the trace is going to stop. In the 1st case the data length will always be
HISI_PTT_TRACE_BUF_SIZE as the interrupt only occurs when one buffer is full.
In the 2nd case we may not have HISI_PTT_TRACE_BUF_SIZE data, the unfilled buffer
is zeroed to be distinguished. We keep committing HISI_PTT_TRACE_BUF_SIZE data
to keep consistence with handling in interrupt and make it simpler here.
(HISI_PTT_TRACE_WR_STS register indicates will buffer is currently used and
the offset in the buffer data is currently writing to)

For the third thing, I'm not sure if we can map the AUX buffer as DMA buffer
and by taht way, considering the case the buffer is full and we need to commit
the AUX buffer and apply a new one, the trace is paused during the procedure and
any TLPs on the link will be missed. But by current approach we won't have
this problem as the tracing is still on even when we're committing the AUX
buffer as the hardware is not directly writing to it.

PTT doesn't support per-task mode. It's not relevant to a certain task.
Will add the check here.

But I don't think the same things are protected here. For PTT trace part,
the mutex intends to 1)protect the filter lists and 2) serialize perf
process to enter start stage.

For 1), the filters in initialized in probe stage and can be dynamically
updated (implemented in Patch 3/7). So the mutex is used to protect the
filter from concurrent access by perf and the updating process. (In this
patch it maybe unnecessary as the filter is static).

For 2), it's used below in ->start() to serialize the CPUs entering start().
Since we want only one CPU to really start the trace. Without the lock,
the cases below may happen:

CPU0				CPU1
start()
.				start()
.				//trace_ctrl.started=false, go on
.				.
hisi_ptt_trace_start()		.
  trace_ctrl.started=true	.
				hisi_ptt_trace_start()

There're some PMU drivers using driver_struct::pmu_lock to serialize the
access to hardware registers and I think the usage is similar (referred to
qcom_l2_pmu.c and arm_dsu_pmu.c).

One thing here as mentioned that I used the mutex for the whole driver,
maybe it's better to split the lock of protecting the filter list and for
the perf process. And the lock for serializing the perf process should
be spinlock as ->start() is in atomic context, I think.

Thanks for the note. Then the handling here is not proper. Will check and
validate the configs here in ->event_init() and move the real initialization
to ->add()/->setup_aux().

It does make sense. will change to use dev_dbg().

We incline to use the cpu on the same node with PTT device. But here intends to handle
the case that user has specified a certain cpu with `perf record -C xxx` and we have to
bind the IRQ to that cpu. In which case we cannot handle in the probe stage.

Thanks for the suggestion. John has noticed the similar that we don't need to allocate
and configure the buffer every time we start trace. So I'll move the allocation
and configuration of DMA buffers into probe stage, then we only need to do it once
and just clear the buffers every time we start trace.

Thanks,
Yicong
