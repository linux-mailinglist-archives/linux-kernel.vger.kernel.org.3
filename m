Hi Mark, Will,

Your comments got me to thinking about the Objtool patch series I have sent earlier.

Since the general feeling is that Objtool is unlikely to be our path to livepatch on ARM64, I think that I can implement what I want in a simpler way as a kernel-only solution. The kernel already has a decoder. I don't need
to provide one. In the kernel-only solution, I don't have to worry about relocations, alternatives, etc, etc.

The number of patches would be about half of the original series with simpler code in many of the patches.

The amount of memory consumed by the CFI entries will most likely be just a fraction of the original series.

I will investigate this. If it works and turns out to be a lot simpler, I will send this as v3 of the livepatch
patch series. Also, if this works, we can replace the various reliability checks with just a single fp validation
check in the unwinder.

Thanks for the input.

Madhavan
