Yeah, I hear you. I'm on the same page.

So, the patch you proposed is making the code remember one special aspect of
user requested configuration - whether it configured it or not, and trying
to preserve that particular state as cpuset state changes. It addresses the
immediate problem but it is a very partial approach. Let's say a task wanna
be affined to one logical thread of each core and set its mask to 0x5555.
Now, let's say cpuset got enabled and enforced 0xff and affined the task to
0xff. After a while, the cgroup got more cpus allocated and its cpuset now
has 0xfff. Ideally, what should happen is the task now having the effective
mask of 0x555. In practice, tho, it either would get 0xf55 or 0x55 depending
on which way we decide to misbehave.

Thanks.
