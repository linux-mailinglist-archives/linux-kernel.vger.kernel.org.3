Because they implement their own pci_ops for the root bus. You should 
too.

The idea was for DWC to not define its own way to have different 
read/write for root bus vs. child bus as many PCI host bridges need the 
same thing. So the host bridge struct now has 2 pci_ops pointers. And 
the mess of function pointer indirection is gone.
