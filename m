Thanks for this Mike! I will bring this to the EDK2 community.

The issue for us is our users use a GCE built EDK2 not their own
compiled version so they don't have the choice. Reading the Azure docs
it seems the same for them, and for AWS so I don't know how often
customers actually get to bring their own firmware.
