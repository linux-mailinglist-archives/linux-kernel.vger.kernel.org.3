The callers of pci_dev_wait() seem to wait for the spec-defined
delay and only call pci_dev_wait() to allow for an additional period
that non-compliant devices may need.  That extra delay can be expected
to be low, which is why it makes sense to start with a short poll interval
and gradually extend it.  So the algorithm seems to be reasonable and
I wouldn't recommend changing it to a constant interval unless that
fixes something which is currently broken.

Thanks,
