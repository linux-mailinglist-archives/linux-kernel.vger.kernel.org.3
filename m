The main thing that bothers me is that it uses simple_pin_fs() and
simple_unpin_fs() which I would try hard to get rid of if possible. The
existence of this global pinning logic makes namespacing it properly
more difficult then it needs to be and it creates imho wonky semantics
where the last unmount doesn't really destroy the superblock. Instead
subsequents mounts resurface the same superblock. There might be an
inherent design reason why this needs to be this way but I would advise
against these semantics for anything that wants to be namespaced.
Probably the first securityfs mount in init_user_ns can follow these
semantics but ones tied to a non-initial user namespace should not as
the userns can go away. In that case the pinning logic seems strange as
conceptually the userns pins the securityfs mount as evidenced by the
fact that we key by it in get_tree_keyed().
