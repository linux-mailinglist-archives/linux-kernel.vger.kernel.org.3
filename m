There are several points of having this supported.
First of all, generic PCIe DT-bindings permit having the dma-ranges
specified for the PCIe RCs. If so having it unsupported by the driver
just breaks the bindings or at least makes it incomplete.
Second, the main point of this patchset is to add the dma-ranges
support.) Especially seeing some other PCIe RC drivers do have it
supported too.
Finally. It is required for our platform (and for all the platforms
with similar issues). The problem is that the outbound source window
base address (on CPU-side) is size-unaligned. It resides at the 128MB
base address (size is somewhat about ~335MB). In case of the
one-on-one CPU->PCI mapping the peripherals with relatively big BARs
(at least of 256MB) and which need the BARs having size-aligned memory
won't be supported. So we had to remap the PCIe space to the
size-aligned base address. But in its turn that caused the PCIe-CPU
memory overlap. So PCIe DMA stopped working for the overlapped memory
due to the implicit P2P transactions. In order to fix that we had to
add the dma-ranges support to the DW PCIe driver and use it to remap
the overlapped memory. So please add this patch to the repo. We really
need it.
