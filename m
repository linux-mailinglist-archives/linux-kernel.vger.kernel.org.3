Ou, sorry for that! I have generated this patch for U-Boot and Linux
kernel and probably mixed or forgot to include correct recipients for
correct project.

Yes, PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI_NORMAL is a new constant for common pci header
file defined in patch linked in commit message.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20211220145140.31898-1-pali@kernel.org/

Originally I included this change in v1 of linked patch in December but
I realized that it does not match standard PCI config space (different
offset 0x43c vs 0x08 and also different shift 0x8 vs 0x0) and probably
there is something either incorrect or really non-standard. So later in
December I dropped iproc_pcie_check_link() change in v2 of the linked
patch where is introduced PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI_NORMAL and now sent new
change for iproc_pcie_check_link() separately.

Technically, linked patch in commit message is just extracting code into
the common macros without any functional changed. But change in this
iproc_pcie_check_link() has also functional change as now also lower 8
bits of class code are changed. So in my opinion this patch should be
really separate of linked patch.

I hope that Lorenzo and Bjorn take patches in correct order...

Perfect!
