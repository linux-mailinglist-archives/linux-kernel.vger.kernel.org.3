As said, it is more easily triggered in a cgroup v2 environment. 
Systemd, on a cgroup v2 environment, will write "+cpuset" to the root 
cgroup's subtree_control file when a new container is instantiated. I 
don't know why it is doing that, but that cause problem as it resets all 
the cpus_allowed list assignment. Cgroup v1 doesn't have this problem.

The reset is done on all cgroups in a particular subtree. In the case of 
cgroup root, it is all the processes in the system.

I also thought about that. Another possible alternative is to use the 
intersection of cpuset's cpu list and task's own cpu list as long as it 
is not empty. Reducing the number of cpus assigned to a task may produce 
some unexpected behavior too.

I think so, but memory binding is less frequently used and its effect is 
less noticeable.
