Before I start any move and don't get it right:

Is this to be done like in the current set of patches in those steps 
where one thing is moved after another?


>     - define, setup, and expose init_ima_ns


We do this alongside the move of the individual pieces into 
ima_namesapce as is done across the patches now? Most of those 'move' 
patches haven't received much feedback so far.

And not pass get_current_ns() down from the top level and access the 
right away via ns->foobar but use init_ima_ns.foobar instead?

I am wondering how this new series is going to relate to the existing 
series and the links you suggest be added on a per patch basis? How much 
of the existing patches can be preserved?

The existing series tried this by enabling IMA namespacing support when 
SecurityFS is enabled... Is that also the last step then in what you 
suggest?
