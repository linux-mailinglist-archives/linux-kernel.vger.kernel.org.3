The runtime overhead should be minimal. It is the behavioral side that 
we should be careful about. It is a change in existing behavior and we 
don't want to cause surprise to the users. Currently, a task that set 
its cpu affinity explicitly will have its affinity reset whenever there 
is any change to the cpuset it belongs to or a hotplug event touch any 
cpu in the current cpuset. The new behavior we are proposing here is 
that it will try its best to keep the cpu affinity that the user 
requested within the constraint of the current cpuset as well as the cpu 
hotplug state.

Users can use sched_getaffinity(2) to retrieve the current cpu affinity. 
It is up to users to set another one if they don't like the current one. 
I don't think we need to return what the previous requested cpu affinity 
is. They are suppose to know that or they can set their own if they 
don't like it. \
