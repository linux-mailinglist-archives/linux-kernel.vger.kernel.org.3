Hi,

I went through the series and I don't have any specific objections.

We can try to queue it for v5.19, with the caveat that the fixes
_need_ testing on several DWC platforms (and I _strongly_ encourage
DWC maintainers to chime in). To sum it up:

- It is a mixture of clean-ups and fixes. I would prefer having the
  cleanups earlier in the series and rebase (if there is a need, I
  can try to reshuffle the patches myself) the fixes on top. That
  because we may have to drop some of the fixes (and if we merge them
  we may have to revert them as cleanly as we can), my concern is that
  they require testing on a number of platforms you have not been
  exposed to
- Kbot complained about patch (3)
- I will have comments about the commit logs but I can try to fix them
  myself

I have concerns especially about patches (2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9), because
they can affect DWC platforms other than the ones you are testing on.

The cleanups we can definitely queue them up. As I said, and there
is nothing I can do about it, I will be off the radar for two months
from wednesday, please try to repost with the Kbot issue fixed and
with the comments above in mind and I will do my best to queue as
many patches from this series as possible for v5.19.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
