Aha, and no_profile_instrument_function disables that.

Hmm, right, there is a

        .p2align        4, 0x90                         # -- Begin function __llvm_gcov_init
        .type   __llvm_gcov_init,@function
__llvm_gcov_init:                       # @__llvm_gcov_init

in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.s which contains native_write_cr4() which does

	jmp     llvm_gcov_init@PLT

and that function is part of initcalls:

	.section	.init_array.0,"aw",@init_array
	.p2align	3
	.quad	__llvm_gcov_init
	.section	.init_array.1,"aw",@init_array
	.p2align	3
	.quad	asan.module_ctor
	.section	.fini_array.1,"aw",@fini_array
	.p2align	3
	.quad	asan.module_dtor
	.type	.L___asan_gen_.313,@object      # @___asan_gen_.313
	.section	.rodata.str1.1,"aMS",@progbits,1

which, AFAICT, gets called by kernel_init_freeable->do_basic_setup->do_ctors()

which is a lot later than x86_64_start_kernel() so I guess the
__no_profile tag for that function probably makes sense as a fix.

No, this is still highly appreciated - thanks for taking the time!

Nice filtering. :-)

I did Cc llvm@lists.linux.dev in the hope that you guys would see it.

Ah, that's an interesting point:

$ grep -E "(GCOV|KASAN)" /tmp/config-5.16.0-rc3-00003-gf154f290855b | grep -v "^#"
CONFIG_KASAN_SHADOW_OFFSET=0xdffffc0000000000

Aha, so it used to work, apparently. Or the NPM is adding additional
code which needs to be initialized because it works ok after the
constructors have run.

Right.

Ok, thanks for the insights, let's see what Nick figures out here.

Thx.
