Very good, thank you!

One more thing...

This assumes that when the slab allocator gets a fresh slab from mm,
that slab has been zeroed, right?  Or is there some other trick that
you are using to somehow accommodate randomly initialized memory?

Or am I just blind today and missing where the zeroing always happens
(other than for pages destined for userspace)?

I do like the very lightweight validation checks!

My mental model of this sort of validation always involved expensive
atomic operations.  ;-)
