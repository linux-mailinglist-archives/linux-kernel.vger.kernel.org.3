Any PCIe card is potentially hotpluggable (seems nobody actually cares
in 90%+ drivers in the Linux kernel). But what I have heard in a
thread (not this one IIRC) is that the card may have pluggable modules
and it would be nice to change configuration and notify OS somehow. I
might be mistaken if it's the case here or not.
