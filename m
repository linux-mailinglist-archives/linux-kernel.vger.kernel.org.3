This makes it sound like a few unusual configurations will route TLPs
based on memory addresses, but address routing is the default for all
PCIe Memory Requests, and ACS provides a way to override that default.

I would say "the Requester ID/PASID combination forms a distinct
address space."

I think your patch actually requires all those features to be not just
"supported" but actually *enabled* for the entire path leading to the
device.

To use the terms from the spec:

  "P2P Request Redirect"
  "P2P Completion Redirect"
  "Requester ID, Requests, and Completions"

and maybe something like:

  ... even if the TLP looks like a P2P Request because its memory
  address (ignoring the PASID) would fall in a bridge window and would
  normally be routed downstream.

Does the PCIe spec really allow TLPs with PASID to be routed anywhere
except upstream?  It seems nonsensical to route them downstream, and
hardware should be able to check that easily.  But I took a quick look
through the spec and didn't see anything about PASID by itself
influencing routing.
