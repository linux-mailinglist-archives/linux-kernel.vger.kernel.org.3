Sorry, you are right, I did something really stupid when preparing the
mail (I manually modified one that was ready so send and already
encoded...). Here are the links:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?h=master&id=13a8e0f6b01b14b2e28ba144e112c883f03a3db2
https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=9cbffc7*

But I just noticed that's not the only stupid thing I did, as the linked
commit in next (13a8e0f6b01b) is part of a series:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220819221616.2107893-1-saravanak@google.com/

The series fixes the regression "Regression: PM: domains: Delete usage
of driver_deferred_probe_check_state" that is in the list from regzbot:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/DU0PR04MB941735271F45C716342D0410886B9@DU0PR04MB9417.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com/

But there are more reports, for example:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/YvrkjH6%2FFpIzyAv+@euler/

Not sure if Greg didn't sent them to you because he think they need more
time or because he's simply afk/busy and didn't manage to send pull
requests.

Guess waiting another week won't do too much harm.

Ciao, Thorsten
