My goal was to properly account kernfs and simple_xattr entries only, 
however I missed that it does not work in cgroup1 case.

No, the goal is not to prevent unlimited creation of cgroup objects.
As Michal Hocko pointed it can be done via cgroup.max.descendants limits.

I would like to properly handle cgroup1 case too.
To do it we can enable accounting for new 'struct cgroup' objects, 
and bind them to memcg of creator task.

Thank you,
