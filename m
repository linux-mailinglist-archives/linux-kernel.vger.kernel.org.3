As my channel description now reads:

In the advent of C64 mini. Where Flash Gordon, Skate or Die, Sanxion 
(Zzap Version) where Rob Hubbards best tracks. Later producer Bit and 
nearby CRB was two of the main actors in the Amiga Scene, and exited in 
93/94 respectively. TBL took over for both for PC Scene, And Zelda OOT 
took over for this again for the mainstream. And artists like Kyary 
Pamyu Pamyu represents the legacy.

And Bit became more famous for Mar Trance production.

Now relevant Indie culture again, with Bitcoin 3D printing, and Open 
Source Nix.
The soundchip named after ùíÆùíæùíπ, a translation term in The Quran, like 
the electronics industry ZIN. While San Francisco Bay Area combines 
both. And Buddhism seems based on the form ùíÆùíæùíπùíΩùìä. And we spice it 
up, with some more from it. And our Red Cube symbol follows, with 
correct translation. (www for more).

 From Drammen, In Hyperia (muslim name)/Norway, home of The Vikings 
(dwelled by the bay, actually Creekstead River, where I grew up).

Serenity,
Bit, producer.
