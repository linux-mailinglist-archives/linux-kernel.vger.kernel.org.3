I used the term 'Linux setup kernel' just to encapsulate the
entrypoints, compressed kernel, and pre-"kernel proper" code. As for
boot protocol, I believe the SLRT is what you are looking for, and we
are in the process of drafting and verifying with a prototype.

Literally, this is not how the hardware works nor in line with the
architecture developed by TrenchBoot. By doing the Dynamic Launch Event
(DLE) the system, meaning the CPU, has effectively been reset. The
CPU/Dynamic Configuration Environment (DCE) is expecting to be provided
a kernel to measures, an entrypoint within that kernel to jump to, and
that kernel understands the reset state of the system. As agreed, the
callback approach is the most satisfactory approach to allow the
efi-stub to do its private protocol. Once the flow has switched to a
dynamic launch, the system is now starting the kernel via a dynamic
launch sequence. The dynamic launch entrypoint, sl-stub, is and will be
used as the entrypoint regardless of the firmware,
UEFI/coreboot/oreboot/slimboot/etc., or CPU vendor, Intel/AMD, in use.
Once efi-stub finishes and invokes the callback, its job is complete and
the new dl-handler along with sl-stub from the current patch set will
handle the system and security setup needed before entering into the
kernel proper.

To help provide clarity, consider the following flows for comparison,

Normal/existing efi-stub:
  EFI -> efi-stub -> head_64.S

Proposed secure launch:
  EFI -> efi-stub -> dl-handler -> [cpu] -> sl_stub ->head_64.S

Effectively, all this is doing is after efi-stub is done, instead of
jumping into head_64.S, it will call the dynamic launch handler to do
the dynamic launch, let sl_stub bring the system back into an expected
state, and then enter head_64.S just as efi-stub would have done.

I am not sure how you make that jump, but as I stated above, when
incorporating dynamic launch it is no longer a straight pass from EFI to
kernel proper. The sl-stub is there to provide a common entry point from
the CPU as the result of a dynamic launch, regardless of firmware or
vendor. Once sl-stub is done with its start-of-day setup, it will jump
to the same location efi-stub would have jumped. This means, efi-stub
does everything it always has and is free to change what it does. The
only addition is that it will now enable a call-out to allow secure
launch to do what it needs to do, and then execution returns back to
head_64.S. To be concise, it specifically returns where efi-stub would
have jumped to without removing or circumventing anything from the
existing flow.

It should also be noted that sl-stub will not be looking to reconfigure
the kernel. It will use the kernel as it was set up by efi-stub. The
only job of sl-stub is to make the world right, measure what efi-stub
provided for measurement, and then enter the kernel proper. The design
of the SLRT structure below is specifically not to bind to anything from
the efi-stub ABI/API. The only information needed to take the
measurements is the location of any config items, their size, and an
identifier for each item. The efi-stub is free to add to and/or remove
from the list of items, along with changing where it is stored, or even
change the format of existing items. The one recommendation, not
requirement, is that the identifiers should not freely be changed. While
it has no impact on sl-stub, it will likely be unpopular with anyone
attempting to keep a manifest of valid efi-stub config items for
attestation verification. It will result in having to maintain a
volatile two-parameter map of (kernel version, identifier) to config
item, at a minimum.

The intent here was not to devise a new EFI protocol. This table is an
agnostic structure that all TrenchBoot Secure Launch implementations
will be using for all firmware environments, and will provide platform
relevant sections like the EFI section outlined above. The table will
inform the dl-handler so that it may take appropriate setup actions for
the dynamic launch. The larger user of the table will be the sl-stub,
which it will use to have an understanding of the world it inherited
from whomever invoked the dynamic launch.

Actually, those items are already in well-defined locations for which we
are already taking measurements. The items of concern are the items
being passed or configured that are stored outside the boot params. For
instance, ROM files passed to the kernel or EFI environment variables
that efi-stub may have set and/or will be used by the kernel.
