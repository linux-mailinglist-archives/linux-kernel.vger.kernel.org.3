I'm thinking about the PCI side of the host controller, which should
live by the PCI rules.  There are device-specific ways to control
power, clocks, resets, etc on the PCI side, but drivers for PCI
devices (as opposed to drivers for the host controllers) can't really
call that code directly.

There are some exceptions, but generally speaking I don't think PCI
drivers that use generic power management need to use PCI_D0,
PCI_D3hot, etc directly.  Generic PM uses interfaces like
pci_pm_suspend() that keep most of the PCI details in the PCI core
instead of the endpoint driver, e.g., [3].

The PCI core has a bunch of interfaces:

  platform_pci_power_manageable()
  platform_pci_set_power_state()
  platform_pci_get_power_state()
  platform_pci_choose_state()

that currently mostly use ACPI.  So I'm wondering whether there's some
way to extend those platform_*() interfaces to call the native host
controller device-specific power control code via an ops structure.

Otherwise it feels like the native host controller drivers are in a
different world than the generic PM world, and we'll end up with every
host controller driver reimplementing things.

For example, how would we runtime suspend a Root Port and turn off
power for PCI devices below it?  Obviously that requires
device-specific code to control the power.  Do we have some common
interface to it, or do we have to trap config writes to PCI_PM_CTRL or
something?

I must be talking about something different than you are.  I see that
brcmstb has device-specific code to control the brcmstb device as well
as power for PCI devices downstream from that device.

When I read "endpoint driver" I think of a PCIe Endpoint device like a
NIC.  That's just a random PCI device, and I read "endpoint driver to
turn on its own regulators" as suggesting that the NIC driver (e1000,
etc) would turn on power to the NIC.  Is that the intent?
