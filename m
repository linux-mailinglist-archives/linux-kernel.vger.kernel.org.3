Dear  Friend

I never intend using this message to offset you, but to create direct contact with you as regard my situation. God has directed me to you,w ho you can be of help to me. Before I proceed further, I am Kama Diouf, the son of Chief Johnny, a famous farmer from Zimbabwe. Who was killed during the fight against white farmer that lasted over two (2) years? Before the death of my father, he had already deposited the sum of $25 million United States dollars under the care of private security financial firm waiting for immediate onward transfer of these funds.

I hereby invite you as my foreign benefactor to this transaction. I believe that you can stand to represent me and my family to invest this money wisely on our behalf in your country. I agree to offer you 25% for your assistance and another 5% for any cost that you might incur during this short time to conclude this transaction. I wait for your urgent response as to proceed. 
Thank you.
