What's the connection with Thunderbolt?  I see "thunderbolt
0000:0a:00.0" in dmesg, but I think we see that message only because
0a:00.0 happens to be in the hierarchy below the 00:1d.0 Root Port,
not specifically because it's a Thunderbolt device.

Here's the hierarchy:

  0000:00:1d.0 Root Port              to [bus 08-71]
  0000:08:00.0 Switch Upstream Port   to [bus 09-71]
  0000:09:00.0 Switch Downstream Port to [bus 0a]
  0000:0a:00.0 Endpoint (USB controller)
  0000:09:01.0 Switch Downstream Port to [bus 0b-3d]
  0000:09:02.0 Switch Downstream Port to [bus 3e]
  0000:3e:00.0 Endpoint (USB controller)
  0000:09:03.0 Switch Downstream Port to [bus 3f-71]

The error logged by 00:1d.0 is an Unsupported Request with Requester
ID 08:00.0.

I think the only relevant thing is that 08:00.0 has PTM enabled and
00:1d.0 has PTM disabled because pci_prepare_to_sleep() only disables
PTM for Root Ports.  The same thing could happen if 08:00.0 were an
Endpoint or a non-Thunderbolt Switch Upstream Port.

Is entering D3cold relevant here?  I don't know how to tell from dmesg
that we're entering D3cold.  If we actually put 08:00.0 in D3cold, I
don't think we would see the Unsupported Request because 08:00.0 can't
send PTM requests from D3cold.

What do you think of the following possible rework?  I think it's
functionally the same except that it disables PTM on Endpoints as well
as Switch Upstream Ports.
