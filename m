This patchset is a third one in the series created in the framework of
my Baikal-T1 PCIe/eDMA-related work:

[1: In-progress v4] PCI: dwc: Various fixes and cleanups
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220610082535.12802-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
[2: In-progress v3] PCI: dwc: Add hw version and dma-ranges support
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220610084444.14549-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
[3: In-progress v3] PCI: dwc: Add generic resources and Baikal-T1 support
Link: ---you are looking at it---
[4: In-progress v2] dmaengine: dw-edma: Add RP/EP local DMA support
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220503225104.12108-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/

Note it is very recommended to merge the patchsets in the same order as
they are listed in the set above in order to have them applied smoothly.
Nothing prevents them from being reviewed synchronously though.

Originally the patches submitted in this patchset were a part of the series:
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220503214638.1895-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
but due to the reviewers requests the series was expanded to about 30
patches which made it too bulky for a comfortable review. So I decided to
split it up into two patchsets: 2. and 3. in the table above.

Regarding the series content. This patchset is mainly about adding new DW
PCIe platform support - Baikal-T1 PCIe of DW PCIe v4.60a IP-core. But a
set of feature-reach preparations are done first. It starts from
converting the currently available DT-schema into a more flexible schemas
hierarchy with separately defined regs, clocks, resets and interrupts
properties. As a result the common schema can be easily re-used by all the
currently available platforms while the named properties above can be
either re-defined or used as is if the platforms support they. In the
framework of that modification we also suggest to add a set of generic
regs, clocks, resets and interrupts resource names in accordance with what
the DW PCIe hardware reference manual describes and what the DW PCIe core
driver already expects to be specified. Thus the new platform driver will
be able to re-use the common resources infrastructure.

Changelog v2:
- Rename 'syscon' property to 'baikal,bt1-syscon'. (@Rob)
- Move the iATU region selection procedure into a helper function (@Rob).
- Rebase from kernel v5.17 onto v5.18-rc3 since the later kernel has
  already DT bindings converted. (@Rob)
- Use 'definitions' property instead of the '$defs' one. It fixes the
  dt-validate error: 'X is not of type array.'
- Drop 'interrupts' and 'interrupt-names' property from being required
  for the native DW PCIe host.
- Evaluate the 'snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml' schema in the
  'socionext,uniphier-pcie-ep.yaml' DT-bindings since the later has
  platform-specific names defined.

Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220503225104.12108-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru
Changelog v3:
- Split up the patch "dt-bindings: PCI: dwc: Define common and native DT
  bindings" into a series of modifications. (@Rob)
- Detach this series of the patches into a dedicated patchset.
- Add a new feature patch: "PCI: dwc: Introduce generic controller
  capabilities interface".
- Add a new feature patch: "PCI: dwc: Introduce generic resources getter".
- Add a new cleanup patch: "PCI: dwc: Combine iATU detection procedures".
- Add a method to at least request the generic clocks and resets. (@Rob)
- Add GPIO-based PERST# signal support to the core module.
- Redefine Baikal-T1 PCIe host bridge config space accessors with the
  pci_generic_config_read32() and pci_generic_config_write32() methods.
  (@Rob)
- Drop synonymous from the names list in the common DT-schema since the
  device sub-schemas create their own enumerations anyway.
- Rebase onto kernel v5.18.
