Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Dominic Amar. A computer scientist with UBA Bank. I am 28
years old, just started work with UBA Bank. I came across your file
which was marked X and your released Disk painted RED, I took time to
study it and found out that you have paid VIRTUALLY all fees and
certificate but the fund has not been release to you. The most
annoying thing is that they cannot tell you the truth that on no
account will they ever release the fund to you, Please this is like a
Mafia setting in Benin Republic; you may not understand it because you
are not from this country.

The only thing I will need to release this fund to you is a special
HARD DISK we call it HD120 GIG. I will buy two of it, recopy your
information, destroy the previous one, and punch the computer to
reflect in your bank within 24 banking hours. I will clean up the
tracer and destroy your old file, after which I will run away from
Benin Republic to meet with you.

If you are interested kindly get in touch with me immediately, You
should send to me your convenient phone numbers for easy communication
and also re-confirm your banking details, so that there won't be any
mistake.

Regards,
Mr. Dominic Amar.
