I hope old hands can give some suggestions here about static key VS.
alternative ;). When to use which mechanism, and why.

I think you found one bug here.
I believe alternative mechanism also doesn't work for XIP kernel. I will
submit a patch for this case.

do you mean the icache overhead due to the other disabled branch of
static key? It deserves a check.

Maybe implement the standard svpbmt via. static key and cope with D1 as
errata alternative.

From Documentation/riscv/patch-acceptance.rst, the "Submit Checklist
Addendum" section, "we'll only to accept patches for extensions that
have been officially frozen or ratified by the RISC-V Foundation."
This rule hasn't been changed.
Per my understanding of history of the svpbmt patch set, no future
special cases any more.
