Hi Stephen,

 Â  Thanks for the idea. But doesn't adding dwc3 as a component to an agg
driver meanthat this change needs to be done on all glue drivers, as
component_bind_all( ) from master componentis supposed to let the dwc3
core know that we are good to go ?

Since the issue we are facing is that the ssphy device links are not ready
causing the dwc3 probe not being invoked, can we add an API as Pavan 
suggested
to check if deferred_probe listfor dwc3 device is empty or not andbased on
that we can choose to defer our qcomprobe ? In this case, we don't need to
touch the dwc3 core driver and would be making changesonly in qcom glue 
driver.
