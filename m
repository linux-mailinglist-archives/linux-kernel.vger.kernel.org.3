Do you have any data to back these claims? Is this something that could
be handled on the configuration level? E.g. by applying low limit
protection to keep the workingset in the memory?

So let me just expand your example for clarity

A.cgroup.controllers = memory
A.cgroup.subtree_control = memory

A/B.cgroup.controllers = memory
A/B.cgroup.subtree_control = memory
A/B/B1.cgroup.controllers = memory

A/C.cgroup.controllers = memory
A/C.cgroup.subtree_control = ""
A/C/C1.cgroup.controllers = ""

Is your concern that C1 is charged to A/C or that you cannot actually make
A/C.cgroup.controllers = "" because you want to maintain memory in A?
Because that would be breaking the internal node constrain rule AFAICS.

Or maybe you just really want a different hierarchy where
A == root_cgroup and want the memory acocunted in B
(root/B.cgroup.controllers = memory) but not in C (root/C.cgroup.controllers = "")?

That would mean that C memory would be maintained on the global (root
memcg) LRUs which is the only internal node which is allowed to have
resources because it is special.
