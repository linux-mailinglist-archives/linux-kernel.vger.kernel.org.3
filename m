Pali, you wrote in the past that you cannot run one command to install
dtschema ("pip") thus for you this automated testing is
difficult/broken/non working. If running one "pip" command is not
possible, what I can say more? Shall I login to your machine and set it
up? Or did you configure your machine that way, that it is not possible
to run one pip command?

Whether the patches are waiting for months and years is difficult to
address to, without actual links. Because for sure you will be able to
find one patch which was missed in our inboxes and you did not get an
answer...  With Rob we both work much more than reasonable/healthy 8h
per day... Yet I recall you always received feedback, just not always
what you expected or wanted.

This binding here was never sent to mailing list:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=cznic%2Cturris-omnia-mcu

It brings quite nice value - allows to check whether your bindings and
your DTS are correct. Any difficulty to install and run dtschema is not
equal to "does not bring any value"...

Anyway devices cannot go without bindings, thus it's a NAK.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
