This should be reported and investigated. Because per-application memcg
vs. memcg in general shouldn't make much of a difference from the
performance side. I can see a potential performance impact for no-memcg
vs. memcg case but even then 15% is quite a lot.

I do not get that part. The parent can manange and control the memory
usage so how come it cannot be managed at all?
