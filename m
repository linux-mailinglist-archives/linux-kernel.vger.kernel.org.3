Maybe.  It is simpler if rank doesn't change, though.

Sure.  We can merge set_memtier and memtier into a single file (no
symlink) for read/write.

All of these are good ideas, though I am afraid that these can make
tier management too complex for what it's worth.

How about an alternative tier numbering scheme that uses major.minor
device IDs?  For simplicity, we can just start with 3 major tiers.
New tiers can be inserted in-between using minor tier IDs.
