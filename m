Hello!

I'm totally up for the proposed feature! It makes total sense and is proved
to be useful, let's add it.

Maybe an option to specify a timeout? That might simplify the userspace part.
Also, please please add a test to selftests/cgroup/memcg tests.
It will also provide an example on how the userspace can use the feature.

What I'm worried about is how we gonna extend it? How do you see the interface
with 2-3 extensions from the list above? All these extensions look very
reasonable to me, so we'll likely have to implement them soon. So let's think
about the extensibility now.

I wonder if it makes more sense to introduce a sys_reclaim() syscall instead?
In the end, such a feature might make sense on the system level too.
Yes, there is the drop_caches sysctl, but it's too radical for many cases.

Btw, why not on root?
