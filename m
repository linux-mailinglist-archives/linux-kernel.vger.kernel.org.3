Yes! It looks like that if module unloading is allowed then .remove
callback would be called despite suppress_bind_attrs was set.

From reading kernel code it looks like that mapping is created when
some other driver request shared INTx IRQ. So it is not done by
pci-aardvark.c but e.g. by wifi driver ath9k (which uses INTx).

Documentation says:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/irq/irqdomain.c?h=v5.18#n240

/**
 * irq_domain_remove() - Remove an irq domain.

 *
 * This routine is used to remove an irq domain. The caller must ensure
 * that all mappings within the domain have been disposed of prior to
 * use, depending on the revmap type.

I think that if IRQ is not used it could be disposed (no need to have it
mapped). So if this IRQ from platform_get_irq() is not shared then in
pci controller driver .remove callback for sure it is not used anymore.
So for non-shared IRQs this looks fine.

Beware that there are IRQs which pci controller uses as "client" and
then there may be also IRQs which pci controller driver allocates via
own IRQ chip driver and provides for other drivers (e.g. as chained irq
handler). So it is needed to distinguish between them. IRQs which
controller driver create via own IRQ chip driver have to be properly
cleaned when calling .remove driver. IRQ which controller driver get via
platform_get_irq() (or similar of method) is under parent driver control
and parent driver is responsible for proper dispose/cleanup.

In pcie-qcom.c there is no irq reference. So maybe it is safe? But I do
not understand designware driver API design...

The best is probably to do runtime test. Boot kernel with pci=nomsi and
connect some PCIe card which supports legacy INTx interrupt. This should
force usage of INTx. Check that card driver is loaded and in file
/proc/interrupts is IRQ line for that driver. Then rmmod pci controller
driver and check that IRQ line in /proc/interrupts disappeared. And also
check that /sys/kernel/debug/irq/irqs/<num> does not exist.

Also another runtime test is to call rmmod and modprobe of pci
controller driver more times (with PCIe card connected) and check that
IRQ numbers assigned to card in /proc/interrupts are same. If after
rmmod + modprobe sequence are numbers increasing then there is some
IRQ-leak in .remove callback.

Anyway, this issue was discovered by Hajo Noerenberg as a "Side note:"
during debugging SATA controller:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216094#c31

It looks like that on some machines rmmod cause immediate kernel crash
and on other machines it is hard to reproduce.
