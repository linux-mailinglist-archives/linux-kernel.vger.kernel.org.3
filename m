I think it's nice to include the warning in the commit log (and even
the way to *generate* the warning if it's more complicated than
"make") because that helps others verify the commit.

I just don't want the warning to be the *reason* for the commit
because it's too easy to focus on quickly removing the warning without
fully understanding whether there is an underlying defect.
