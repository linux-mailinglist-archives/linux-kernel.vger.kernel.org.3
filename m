Please describe the user visible effects of this change. IIUC this is
changing the vmpressure semantic for pre-existing users (v1 when setting
the hard limit for example) and it really should be explained why
this is good for them after those years. I do not see any actual bug
being described explicitly so please make sure this is all properly
documented.
