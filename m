This is a two-way street. Securityfs namespacing places requirements on
the callers as well. I won't bend generic vfs infrastucture to our will
because some users want to remove dentries at random points. It is on
the users to make sure that they don't cause UAFs when securityfs is
umounted. And that isn't that hard to do. You just need to guard removal
in .kill_sb() with a lock against a concurrent securityfs_remove() call
that some piece of code might want to issue and make sure that any
stashed stuff is properly invalidated.

The point is that we don't need all this right now since we only have
ima as user. I did not say that it cannot be done I said we don't need
to do it for ima. So I feel discussing this point further is deterring
the patches more than it helps them.
