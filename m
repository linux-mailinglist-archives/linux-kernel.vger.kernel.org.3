Hi Bjorn,

Yes, I meant it to skip the turning on of the regulators if the DT
node was missing
but I failed to notice that it would also skip the pcie linkup as well.  As you
may have guessed, all of my test systems have the PCIe root port
DT node.

Yes. One repo did not have this node (Cyril/debina?), one did
(https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot).
Of course there is nothing wrong with omitting the node; it should
have pcie linkup regardless.

You are absolutely correct and I must change the commit message
to say the "root port DT node".   I'm sorry; this mistake likely did not
help you understand the fix. :-(

The regulator_bulk_get()  func does not fail if the regulators are not
present.  Instead it "gets"
a dummy device and issues a warning per missing regulator.
A version of my pullreq submitted code to prescan the DT node and call
regulator_bulk_get() with
only the names of the regulators present, but IIRC this was NAKd.
Hopefully I will not be swamped with RPi developers'  emails when they
think these warnings are an issue.

I was just adding  background information but I see that I really
didn't answer your
question.   Allow me another chance:

When brcm_pcie_add_bus() is invoked, we will "get" and enable any
regulators that are present in the DT node.  If the busno==1, we will
will also attempt pcie-linkup.  If PCIe linkup fails, which can happen for
multiple reasons but most due to a  missing device, we turn
on "refusal" mode to prevent our unforgiving PCIe HW from causing an
abort on any subsequent PCIe config-space accesses.  Further,
a failed linkup will have brcm_pcie_probe() stopping and removing
the root bus, which in turn invokes  brcm_pcie_remove_bus() (actually
named pci_subdev_regulators_remove_bus() as it may someday find its
way into bus.c), which invokes regulator_bulk_disable() on any
regulators that were enabled by the probe.

If there was no linkup during the probe, the probe follows this
path before it returns with error:

brcm_pcie_probe()
    brcm_pcie_remove()
        pci_stop_root_bus();
        pci_remove_root_bus();
            pci_remove_bus_device()
                pci_remove_bus_device()
                    pci_subdev_regulators_remove_bus()
                        regulator_bulk_disable()

Got it.

Unless you object, I plan on sending you a v2 of my regression fix which will
correct the commit message, change the "if (busno == 1)" conditional to
only guard the pcie linkup call, and add further comments.

I have noted and will also address your other concerns and suggestions
in a future
patchset as I think it is best that I get my hands on a CM4 board
before I submit
any more changes.
