Sadly, I would not assume that. :(

Just looking at the ELBI registers between Exynos and this one, the
registers look completely different with nothing shared between the 2.
Maybe sharing is possible with some new, yet to be upstreamed Samsung
PCIe IP, but not the existing one. Same vendor is not always a good
reason to share a driver.

I think the way to further shrink the vendor DWC drivers is getting
the DWC core and PCI core to do more in terms of clocks, resets, and
phys management, handling of PERST, and link state management. We
should also get rid of vendor drivers doing their own abstraction
layers (ops structs) (looking at you QCom).
