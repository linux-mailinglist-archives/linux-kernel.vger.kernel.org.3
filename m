I *think* this is OK.  Correct me if I'm wrong:

  - We're talking about a Root Port.

  - The Root Port's PTM Capability reads as 0x00000406 (PTM Responder
    Capable and PTM Root Capable set).

  - Without this patch, setting PTM Enable does nothing, and the Root
    Port does not send PTM Responses.

    This is the non-conforming situation because the Port claims that
    it implements the PTM Responder role, but it can't actually be
    enabled.

  - With this patch that sets CDNS_PCIE_LM_TPM_CTRL_PTMRSEN, the PTM
    Enable bit still powers up as zero, so the Port does not send PTM
    Responses, but setting PTM Enable enables PTM Responses from the
    Root Port.

So I think that after setting CDNS_PCIE_LM_TPM_CTRL_PTMRSEN, the PTM
capability works as per spec.

I think the proposed subject of "Enable Controller to respond to
received PTM Requests" is somewhat misleading, though, because PTM
responses still aren't enabled until we set PTM Enable.  I suggest
something like:

  PCI: cadence: Allow PTM Responder to be enabled
