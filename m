The image to be loaded is not really firmware and not really a partial 
reconfiguration image.Â  It is both.

Which image is used depends on the end user's workload for the n3000 and 
could change and need reloading day to day.

Because the n3000 is unusable without this change, I would like to see 
updating working first for the n3000.

Then the interface generalized as other devices are found that have a 
similar use case.

This is a device specific feature so it should go somewhere like 
drivers/fpga/dfl-n3000-update.c
