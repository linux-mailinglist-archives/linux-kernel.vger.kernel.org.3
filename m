An interesting solution would be to queue irq_work in CPU that
is occupied by the long-running kernel task.

It might be queued from klp_try_complete_transition() that
is called from the regular klp_transition_work_fn().

Then the task might try to migrate itself from the irq_work.
But the problem is that stack_trace_save_tsk_reliable() probably
will not be able to store a reliable backtrace for the interrupted
task.

So, we might really need to stop the task (CPU). But there still
might be problem if stack_trace_save_tsk_reliable() will consider
the stack as reliable.

Best Regards,
Petr
