Indeed, sorry about that.

On arm64, it was actually a NULL pointer dereference reported by Ivan T.
Ivanov; see

	https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211012082708.121931-1-iivanov@suse.de/

Trying to reproduce this rather bluntly on x86/qemu by multiple manual calls
to add_bootloader_randomness(), I mis-interpreted the symptoms to point to an
infinite recursion. The real problem seems to be that crng_reseed() isn't
ready to be called too early in the boot process, in particular before
workqueues are ready (see the call to numa_crng_init()).

However, there seem be additional issues with add_bootloader_randomness()
not yet addressed (or worsened) by my patch:

	- If CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is enabled and crng_init==0,
	  add_hwgenerator_randomness() calls crng_fast_load() and returns
	  immediately. If it is disabled and crng_init==0,
	  add_device_randnomness() calls crng_slow_load() but still
	  continues to call _mix_pool_bytes(). That means the seed is
	  used more extensively if CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is not
	  set!

	- If CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is enabled and crng_init==0,
	  the entropy is not credited -- same as if
	  CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is not set. Only subsequent calls
	  to add_bootloader_randomness() would credit entropy, but that
	  causes the issue NULL pointer dereference or the hang...

	- As crng_fast_load() returns early, that actually means that my
	  patch causes the additional entropy submitted to
	  add_hwgenerator_randomness() by subsequent calls to be completely
	  lost.

	- For add_bootloader_randomness(), it makes no sense at all to call
	  wait_event_interruptible().

Therefore, it might make more sense to

	- modify add_bootloader_randomness() to always call
	  add_device_randomness(), and if CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is
	  enabled, to call credit_entropy_bits().

	- update credit_entropy_bits() to not call credit_entropy_bits()
	  if crng_global_init_time==0, as workqueues (and possibly other
	  infrastructure) might not be available at that time.

What do you think? Draft patch below. @Ivan: Could you re-test on your
system, please?

Thanks,
	Dominik

Currently, if CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is enabled, mutliple calls
to add_bootloader_randomness() are broken and can cause a NULL pointer
dereference, as noted by Ivan T. Ivanov. This is not only a hypothetical
problem, as qemu on arm64 may provide bootloader entropy via EFI and via
devicetree.

On the first call to add_hwgenerator_randomness(), crng_fast_load() is
executed, and if the seed is long enough, crng_init will be set to 1.
However, no entropy is currently credited for that, even though the
name and description of CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER states otherwise.

On subsequent calls to add_bootloader_randomness() and then to
add_hwgenerator_randomness(), crng_fast_load() will be skipped. Instead,
wait_event_interruptible() (which makes no sense for the init process)
and then credit_entropy_bits() will be called. If the entropy count for
that second seed is large enough, that proceeds to crng_reseed().
However, crng_reseed() may depend on workqueues being available, which
is not the case early during boot.

To fix these issues, unconditionally call add_device_randomness() but not
add_hwgenerator_randomness() in add_bootloader_randomness(). This has the
additional advantage that the seed provided by the first call to
add_bootloader_randomness() is not only used by crng_{fast,slow}_load(),
but also mixed into the input pool. If CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is
set, explicitly credit the entropy. However, avoid a call to crng_reseed()
too early during boot. It is safe to be called after rand_initialize(),
so use crng_global_init_time (which is set to != 0 in that function) to
determine which branch to take.
