Well, I agree this patch does no harm but in my opinion it is just papering
over the real problem which is that we leave bfqq without any request in
the pos_tree which can have also other unexpected consequences. I don't
think your scenario with bfq_release_process_ref() calling
bfq_del_bfqq_busy() really answers my question because we call
bfq_del_bfqq_busy() only if RB_EMPTY_ROOT(&bfqq->sort_list) (i.e., bfqq has
no requests) and when sort_list was becoming empty, bfq_remove_request()
should have removed bfqq from the pos_tree. So I think proper fix lies
elsewhere and I would not merge this patch until we better understand what
is happening in this case.
