Right, after some more inspection the only thing I'm concerned about is:

        /* don't cover already allocated blocks in selected range */
        if (ar->pleft && start <= ar->lleft) {
                size -= ar->lleft + 1 - start;
                start = ar->lleft + 1;
        }

which can shift start beyond ac->ac_o_ex.fe_logical if the block would be
already allocated. But I guess in that case we should not be calling
ext4_mb_normalize_request()? ... some more code digging .. Yes, that is
guaranteed in how lleft is initialized in ext4_ext_map_blocks(). So OK, I
withdraw my objection to the stronger check but the changelog really needs
to do a better job to explain why the stronger condition should be true.
