Code-wise, this LGTM.  There are a few things that could be
improved in the commit message, e.g. in the last paragraph,
"changing" (gerund form) is not proper English and the
imperative form "change" would be correct here.  However,
these details are difficult to get right for anyone who is
not an English native speaker and often Bjorn will wordsmith
the commit message to perfect it.

See here for some of the things Bjorn looks for:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20171026223701.GA25649@bhelgaas-glaptop.roam.corp.google.com/

Bjorn may not find the time to look over your patch immediately,
so please be patient.

Thanks!

Lukas
