Explain that, when collecting list of people to Cc the patch,
scripts/get_maintainer.pl should be used on patches, not on the
directories.  The behavior is quite different, because with "-f" on
a directory, the maintainers of individual files will not be shown.

It seems using the script on patches is not obvious and it already
caused some misunderstandings.

 track down a maintainer for a specific piece of code.
