I don't know whether the race is also possible on a forward
transition.  If the parent task has transitioned, will
the child have, as well, by the time we reach the end of fork?

I suppose the only way the parent task can transition while
inside fork would be if none of the functions in its stack
need to be transitioned, and at that point the child process
would automatically be safe, too?

That would make copying the KLP transition state from parent to
child safe on a forward transition, too.

Am I overlooking anything?

However, we have only observed this warning on reverse transitions
for some reason.

Will do. I'll send a v4 tomorrow.
