Unless XGene 1 has some weird implicit requirement on the order in which 
the registers are programmed, that XGene 2 doesn't. And from looking at 
the code, I don't see any obvious less-mad possibility to explain the 
breakage.

Because devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources() is forcing the 
dma_ranges list to be in a different order from the original DT for 
iommu-dma's benefit, but whether iommu-dma actually consumes it or not 
later is immaterial.
