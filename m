No. The direction of travel has been to define EFI boot only in terms
of the handover from the loader to the stub. What happens next is up
to the architecture, and is deliberately not specified, because it is
considered to be internal Linux ABI. We've deviated from this once for
Xen on ARM, but this means we have already painted ourselves into a
corner when it comes the way we use DT internally at the handover
point between stub and kernel proper, and I am not eager to repeat
that. Locking down the stub-to-kernel protocol for all architectures
is not the way to go.

Wouldn't it be better for the secure launch kernel to boot the EFI
entrypoint directly? As it happens, I just completed a PoC last week
for a minimal implementation of EFI (in Rust) that only carries the
pieces that the EFI stub needs to boot Linux. It is currently just a
proof of concept that only works on QEMU/arm64, but it should not be
too hard to adapt it for x86 and for booting a kernel that has already
been loaded to memory.
