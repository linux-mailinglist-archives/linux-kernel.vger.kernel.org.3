I tend to disagree. There are not only USB devices involved but other
devices that may share the same INTx line(s). This is the case, for
example, on EG20T. Dunno if ATI is one of them, but if so, it will
support the idea of MSI.

Can you elaborate this, please? Where is that code that doesn't work correctly?

I tend to disagree.

Why? What is the point of deliberate degrading of performance?

...

Let do it simple: Apply my patch since it fixes the regression and
move on with whatever solution you may propose latter on. It's really
not good for the end-user who was so kind to report and test all this.
