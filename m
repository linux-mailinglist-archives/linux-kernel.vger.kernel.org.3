My views are on the opposite side. DT is an ABI, full stop. If you
change something, you *must* guarantee forward *and* backward
compatibility. That's because:

- you don't control how updatable the firmware is

- people may need to revert to other versions of the kernel because
  the new one is broken

- there are plenty of DT users beyond Linux, and we are not creating
  bindings for Linux only.

You may disagree with this, but for the subsystems I maintain, this is
the rule I intent to stick to.
