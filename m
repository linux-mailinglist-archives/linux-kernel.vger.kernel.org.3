So the pci-imx6.c driver does wait after the setting of
PCIE_LINK_WIDTH_SPEED_CONTROL for the PCIE_LINK_WIDTH_SPEED_CONTROL
to show PORT_LOGIC_SPEED_CHANGE. Not sure if this is needed in this
case.

I have put this driver in to our CI and it so far seems to be working
in our case. I'm not sure if there's anything we could do better to
detect already initialised values from U-Boot and avoid this. Also I
am questioning if we need some sort of hardware property to control
the behaviour.

Does anyone at SiFive have any more information about whether this fix
is now correct? It is very annoying for us as we network boot and thus
the PCIe does not come up without this fix in.

Note, it is possible the pci-imx6.c driver does not build, could not
find a field called linl in the struct dw_pcie. I will try and see if
this driver is being built or not.
