Currently, bfq can't handle sync io concurrently as long as they
are not issued from root group. This is because
'bfqd->num_groups_with_pending_reqs > 0' is always true in
bfq_asymmetric_scenario().

The way that bfqg is counted into 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs':

Before this patch:
 1) root group will never be counted.
 2) Count if bfqg or it's child bfqgs have pending requests.
 3) Don't count if bfqg and it's child bfqgs complete all the requests.

After this patch:
 1) root group is counted.
 2) Count if bfqg have at least one bfqq that is marked busy.
 3) Don't count if bfqg doesn't have any busy bfqqs.

The main reason to use busy state of bfqq instead of 'pending requests'
is that bfqq can stay busy after dispatching the last request if idling
is needed for service guarantees.

With this change, the occasion that only one group is activated can be
detected, and next patch will support concurrent sync io in the
occasion.

This patch also rename 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs' to
'num_groups_with_busy_queues'.

-	 * terms of composition of the group and active/inactive state of child

-	 * num_groups_with_pending_reqs when the first descendant
-	 * process of the group remains with no request waiting for
-	 * completion.

-	 * Even this simpler decrement strategy requires a little
-	 * carefulness: to avoid multiple decrements, we flag a group,
-	 * more precisely an entity representing a group, as still
-	 * counted in num_groups_with_pending_reqs when it becomes
-	 * inactive. Then, when the first descendant queue of the
-	 * entity remains with no request waiting for completion,
-	 * num_groups_with_pending_reqs is decremented, and this flag
-	 * is reset. After this flag is reset for the entity,
-	 * num_groups_with_pending_reqs won't be decremented any
-	 * longer in case a new descendant queue of the entity remains
-	 * with no request waiting for completion.
