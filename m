Hmm. Struggling on how that is supposed to work in general.
As we're reading from a log to get the sense information I guess that 
log is organized by tag index. Meaning we have to keep hold of the tag 
which generated that error.
Q1: Can we (re-) use that tag to read the log information?
Q2: What do you do if all 32 command generate such an error?

But really, this sounds no different from the 'classical' request sense 
handling in SCSI ML. Have you considered just run with that an map 
'REQUEST SENSE' on your new NCQ Get Log page command?

Cheers,

Hannes
