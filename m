I don't disagree here, there are plenty of examples of bugs that stem
from this in Rockchip's code.
Working on this series has given me ideas for improvements to the
rk3399 controller as well.

Unfortunately this assumption doesn't hold up to testing.
On rk356x this entire register block is 0x0, which if it was
implemented means legacy interrupts would not work, among other
issues.
Even in the rk3588 it's marked as "reserved" which means there's a
good possibility it isn't fully implemented there either.
A number of other blocks in the rk3588 trm are labeled as being
available only after a specific hardware revision.
We are seeing other bugs in the hardware implementation Rockchip has
here, so making assumptions based on other implementations of the DW
IP is unsafe.

You'll find no argument from me here, I'm merely using it as an
example of the vendor's implementation.
The only resources I have available are the publically released
documentation and the publically released downstream code.

The only way to ensure that in a sane way is to trigger the resets at
driver probe.
Can that be safely done without causing other issues with an already
configured card or should I power cycle it as well?
This is starting to feature creep from the original intention of this
series, since a pre-configured controller would affect more than just
interrupts.
If you wish, as a compromise I can ensure all INTx interrupts are
masked at probe (which would hilariously be the opposite of
downstream).
