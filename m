By signing the file hash, the sig field in the IMA measurement list can
be directly verified against the digest field.  For appended
signatures, we defined a new template named ima-modsig which contains
two file hashes, with and without the appended signature.

Similarly, by signing a digest containing other metadata and fs-
verity's file digest, the measurement list should include both digests.
Otherwise the consumer of the measurement list would first need to
calculate the signed digest before verifying the signature.

Options:
- Include just fs-verity's file digest and the signature in the
measurement list.  Leave it to the consumer of the measurement list to
deal with.
- Define a new template format to include both digests, add a new field
in the iint for the signed digest.  (Much more work.)
- As originally posted, directly sign fs-verity's file digest.

thanks,

Mimi
