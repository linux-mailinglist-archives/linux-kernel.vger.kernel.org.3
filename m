-EAGAIN sounds good, too.  Given that the userspace requests to
reclaim a specified number of bytes, I think it is generally better to
tell the userspace whether the request has been successfully
fulfilled. Ideally, it would be even better to return how many bytes
that have been reclaimed, though that is not easy to do through the
cgroup interface. The userspace can choose to ignore the return value
or log a message/update some stats (which Google does) for the
monitoring purpose.

OK, let's then not check against the limit.
