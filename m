What if .. for some systems there would be some requirements that will allow to touch LSM but do not change any IMA (integrity) things? A user can set up any IMA policy (it's about the system integrity), modify IMA related xattrs but it's forbidden to change seLinux policies and e.g. SMACK labels... May be it's unreal scenario of course... but I guess it's not 100% impossible.

If we can introduce a new capability I would use CAP_INTEGRITY_ADMIN, if 
not CAP_MAC_ADMIN.

So effectively entering a user namespace without CAP_SYS_ADMIN but mapping the owner id to 0 (what unshare -r --user does) gives you back a form of CAP_SYS_ADMIN that responds only in the places in the kernel that have a ns_capable() check instead of a capable() one (most of the places you list below).
