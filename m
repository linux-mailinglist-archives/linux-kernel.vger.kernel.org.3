Yes, this firmware is being modified to enforce stricter policy.

Also, the kernel still uses memory, that is not allocated via
EFI boot services, for trampoline placement in the first 640K of
address space, for which NX bit is also set.
The exact address for trampoline code is chosen only after
the EfiExitBootServices() call. And, I think, changing the
code in such way that trampoline is allocated beforehand will
touch more code paths.
