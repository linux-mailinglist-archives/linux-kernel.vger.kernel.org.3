I am just piggybacking on top of the existing page_owner tool to provide 
information for me to find out what pages are pinning the dead memcgs. 
page_owner is a debugging tool that is not turned on by default. We do 
have to add a kernel parameter andÂ  rebooting the system to use that, 
but that is pretty easy to do once we have a reproducer to reproduce the 
problem.
