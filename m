I would agree to supporting passing the fd to other containers to have 
them add rules to the policy, if that's what is intended.

I would treat the IMA files' file descriptors like those of fd = 
open("/top/secret/file", O_RDWR) assuming the programmer knows the 
implications of passing the fd around, including knowing that open fds 
are inherited by child processes... I don't see that there's anything 
wrong with that.
