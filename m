Please be noticed that this patch DOES protect the memcg when external
pressure is 1GB as fixed low does. Besides, how does the admin decide
the exact number of low/min if it expand from small to even xGB in a
quick changing scenario?

Imagin you are playing a game on a 3GB mobile phone while a visual
call is connected. There could be either a dead view of the call
because of the game possess a improper low value or the game be killed
by OOM. IMHO, could we let the user have the choice to configure the
memcg as dynamic protection.

Mlock is for the purpose of easy for test. High pressure could be
introduced by file cache thrashing(mapped so file would have very
short refault distance) or kernel driver allocation(multimedia or AI
scenarios on android). I will retest it without Mlock then.

As I said, I would like to have this patch provide a opt-in choice for
user to establish a kind of desired memcg while bring any change of
current design.
