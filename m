Currently fadvise(2) is supported only for the files that doesn't
associated with noop_backing_dev_info thus for the files, like shmem,
fadvise results into NOP. But then there is file_operations->fadvise()
that lets the file systems to implement their own fadvise
implementation. Use this support to implement some of the POSIX_FADV_XXX
functionality for shmem files.

This patch aims to implement POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED and POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED
advices to shmem files which can be helpful for the drivers who may want
to manage the shmem pages of the files that are created through
shmem_file_setup[_with_mnt]().  An example usecase may be like, driver
can create the shmem file of the size equal to its requirements and
map the pages for DMA and then pass the fd to user. The user who knows
well about the usage of these pages can now decide when these pages are
not required push them to swap through DONTNEED thus free up memory well
in advance rather than relying on the reclaim and use WILLNEED when it
decide that they are useful in the near future. IOW, it lets the clients
to free up/read the memory when it wants to. Another usecase is that GEM
objets which are currenlty allocated and managed through shmem files can
use vfs_fadvise(DONT|WILLNEED) on shmem fd when the driver comes to
know(like through some hints from user space) that GEM objects are not
going to use/will need in the near future.

Some questions asked while reviewing this patch:

Q) Can the same thing be achieved with FD mapped to user and use
madvise?
A) All drivers are not mapping all the shmem fd's to user space and want
to manage them with in the kernel. Ex: shmem memory can be mapped to the
other subsystems and they fill in the data and then give it to other
subsystem for further processing, where, the user mapping is not at all
required.  A simple example, memory that is given for gpu subsystem
which can be filled directly and give to display subsystem. And the
respective drivers know well about when to keep that memory in ram or
swap based on may be a user activity.

Q) Should we add the documentation section in Manual pages?
A) The man[1] pages for the fadvise() whatever says is also applicable
for shmem files. so couldn't feel it correct to add specific to shmem
files separately.
[1] https://linux.die.net/man/2/fadvise

Q) The proposed semantics of POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED is actually similar to
MADV_PAGEOUT and different from MADV_DONTNEED. This is a user facing API
and this difference will cause confusion?
A) man pages [1] says that "POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED attempts to free cached
pages associated with the specified region." This means on issuing this
FADV, it is expected to free the file cache pages. And it is
implementation defined If the dirty pages may be attempted to writeback.
And the unwritten dirty pages will not be freed. So, FADV_DONTNEED also
covers the semantics of MADV_PAGEOUT for file pages and there is no
purpose of PAGEOUT for file pages.

Changes in V4:
  -- Changed the code to use reclaim_pages() to writeout the shmem pages to swap and then reclaim.
  -- Addressed comments from Mark Hemment and Matthew.
  -- fadvise() on shmem file may even unmap a page.

Changes in V3:
  -- Considered THP pages while doing FADVISE_[DONT|WILL]NEED, identified by Matthew.
  -- xarray used properly, as identified by Matthew.
  -- Excluded mapped pages as it requires unmapping and the man pages of fadvise don't talk about them.
  -- RESEND: Fixed the compilation issue when CONFIG_TMPFS is not defined.

Changes in V2:
  -- Rearranged the code to not to sleep with rcu_lock while using xas_() functionality.
  -- Addressed the comments from Suren.
  -- https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-mm/patch/1638442253-1591-1-git-send-email-quic_charante@quicinc.com/

changes in V1:
  -- Created the interface for fadvise(2) to work on shmem files.
