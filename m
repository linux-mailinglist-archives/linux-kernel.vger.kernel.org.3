Which still brings me back to a point made long time ago:  Why are
we doing the renaming to start with?  Add the new functionality and
or changes to seq_buf gradually instead of doing a tree wide sweep.
I don't think the new naming has a huge advantage (in fact I think
the old one actually is a little better, but the biggest argument here
really is to not change something if we don't have to).

That will massively reduce the churn at the cost of Kent having to
rework the code a bit, but that seems like a worthwhile tradeoff and
one that we've usuall made in the past.
