From a conceptual perspective we've thought of the EFI stub as being 
logically part of the bootloader rather than the early kernel, and the 
bootloader is a point where the line is drawn. My guy feeling is that 
jumping into the secure kernel environment before EBS has been called is 
likely to end badly.
