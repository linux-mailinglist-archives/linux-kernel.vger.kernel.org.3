Btw. you might want to have a look at http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20220331084151.2600229-1-yosryahmed@google.com
where a new interface to allow pro-active memory reclaim is discussed.
I think that this might turn out to be a better fit then an automagic
kernel manipulation with a low limit. It will require a user agent to
drive the reclaim though.
