It doesn't have to be right in the user_namespace. The IMA namespace is 
connected to the user namespace and holds the dentries now...

Please spec it out...

Well, that doesn't help us then...

But we need to somehow have a call to get_tree_keyed() and have that 
user namespace switched out. I don't know how else to do this other than 
having some function that does that and that is now called 
securityfs_ns_create_mount().

get_tree_keyed() will also call the fill_super() which is called when 
securityfs_ns_create_mount() is called.

You said it works by 'accident'. I know it works because the function 
securityfs_init_fs_context() that now populates the filesystem via the 
late_fs_init() is getting called twice. Does 'accident' here mean the 
call sequence could change?

Also that we can do for as long as it flies beyond the conversation 
here... :-) Anyone else have an opinion ?
