As suggested by zefan, raise the practical scenario here to make more
sense. The issue is observed in android system where per-app cgroup is
demanded by freezer subsys and part of them require memory control.
Under this scenario, less efficient memory reclaim is observed when
comparing with no memory control. It is believed that multi LRU
scanning introduces some of the overhead. Furthermore, page thrashing
is also heavier than global LRU which could be the consequences of
partial failure of WORKINGSET mechanism as LRU is too short to protect
the active pages.
