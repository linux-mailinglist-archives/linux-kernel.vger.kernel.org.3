Yes. But assembly functions are of two types:

SYM_CODE_*() functions
SYM_FUNC_*() functions

SYM_CODE functions are, by definition, special functions that don't follow any ABI rules.
They don't set up a frame. Based on the opinion of ARM64 experts, these need to be
recognized by the unwinder and, if they are present in a stack trace, the stack trace
must be considered unreliable. I have, in fact, submitted a patch to implement that.

So, only SYM_FUNC*() functions are relevant for this part. I will look into these for arm64
and check if any of them can occur frequently in stack traces. If any of them is likely
to occur frequently in stack traces, I must address them. If there are only a few such
functions, unwind hints may be sufficient. I will get back to you on this.

DWARF annotations are a PITA to maintain. I will never recommend that!

It is only debug info. But if that info can be verified, then it is usable for livepatch
purposes. I am thinking of implementing a verifier since DWARF reliability is a valid
concern. I will keep you posted.

Thanks!
