Currently both DW PCIe Root Port and End-point DT bindings are too generic
to be used as a descriptive set the device properties. Yes, it's very handy
to have them that way so the DT-schemas could be used to evaluate as many
DW PCIe-related DT-nodes as possible. But at the same time they don't
provide well defined DW PCIe RP/EP DT interface description thus leaving
too much flexibility for the new platforms, no encouraging the developers
to preserve a compatible interface. It causes having many
platform-specific DT bindings of the same generic properties.

Instead of currently implemented approach we suggest to be more
restrictive and yet preserve some level of flexibility in the DW PCIe
DT-bindings description. The device tree DT-schema is split up into
three parts: a common YAML-schema applicable for both DWC Root Port and
End-point controller configs, DWC PCIe Root Port-specific YAML-schema
and DWC PCIe End-point-specific YAML-schema, where
1) pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml - the common DT-schema describes the most
generic constraints of the "reg", "interrupts", "clocks", "resets" and
"phys" properties together with a set of common for both device types
PCIe/AXI bus properties like a maximum number of lanes or a maximum link
speed, number of inbound and outbound iATU windows. In addition to that a
set of schema definitions declared under the "definitions" property with
"reg", "interrupt", "clock" and "reset" names common for DWC PCIe Root
Port and End-point devices. They can be used by the successive DT-schemas
in case they are supposed to be compatible with the generic DWC PCIe
controller DT-bindings.
2) pci/snps,dw-pcie.yaml, pci/snps,dw-pcie-ep.yaml - generic DW PCIe Root
Port and End-point DT-bindings which aside with the device-specific
properties set also contain more restrictive constraints. All new DW PCIe
platforms are supposed to be compatible with one of these bindings by
using "allOf: " property and additionally defining their own constraints
to close up the DT-bindings set.

So to speak in case if a DW PCIe-based device for some reason has too many
specific properties or it's bindings have already been defined in a
non-generic way, it's DT-schema is supposed to include 1) YAML-file and
provide its own constraints. Otherwise the ready-to-use bindings from 2)
should be utilized. There are only two DT-schemas compatible with 2) at the
moment are samsung,axynos-pcie.yaml and intel-gw-pcie.yaml. The
rest of the DW PCIe-related DT-schemas are supposed to use more generic
DW PCIe DT-bindings - pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml.

Note the provided here generic properties and their possible values are
derived from the DW PCIe RC/EP hardware manuals and from the interface
implemented in the driver. The DT-bindings schemas are created to be as
full as possible with detailed properties/names description for the
easier interface comprehension and new platforms bindings development.

Also note since there are no generic DT-nodes can be found in the kernel
dts-es which would have a pure "snps,dw-pcie" compatible string, these
DT-bindings have been created to not be selected by default for
evaluation. They are supposed to be used by the new vendor-specific
DT-schemas to at least stop adding new bindings for the same set of DWC
PCIe signals or properties.

If the '$defs' property is used instead of the 'definitions' one, the next
error will be spotted:

The problem is caused by the 'def fixup_sub_schema()' method defined in
the dtschema parser. AFAIU It skips the sub-'$defs'-schemas evaluation thus
not having them fixed up properly. The next patch solves the denoted
problem:

The same effect can be reached just by using the 'definitions' property.
Since I don't know the original reasons of having the fixup skipped for
the '$defs' property, I decided to just take the later path and use the
'definitions' property in the DT schemas. Rob, it's up to you to decide
whether the dtschema parser needs to be fixed.

Changelog v2:
- Use 'definitions' property instead of the '$defs' one. It fixes the
  dt-validate error: 'X is not of type array.'
- Drop 'interrupts' and 'interrupt-names' property from being required for
  the native DW PCIe host.
- Evaluate the 'snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml' schema in the
  'socionext,uniphier-pcie-ep.yaml' DT-bindings since the later has
  platform-specific names defined.
