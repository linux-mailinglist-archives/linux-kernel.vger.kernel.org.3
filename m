Every submitted change needs testing, but in most of the cases a
full comprehensive evaluation just can't be delivered. It doesn't mean
the changes can't be accepted especially if they are logically correct,
well justified, tested on several platforms and already reviewed. All
of that has been already done for this and following up patchsets.

I reported that there are issues in the current code implementation.
They are thoroughly described in the patch logs and fixed by the
corresponding patches. But anyway I couldn't find in any kernel doc
that having a bug report is required to post fixes patch. It's like
waiting for kernel to crash/hangup/etc before getting permission to fix
its bugs.

Note, having Fixes tag doesn't mean the patch always need to be merged
in into the stable trees. It just indicates the commit originating the
issue, helps to review the change and if necessary assists the stable
kernel team in determining which stable kernel versions should receive
your fix (Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst:555).

Also note I haven't Cc'ed the stable team reviewers so basically the
patches aren't strictly required to be merged into the stable kernels.

see my comment above regarding the requirement you are stating. There
must be some confusion regarding stable kernel patches, having bug
reports and full cross-platform testing. If you suggest to wait while
the series are tested on all the supported platforms we most likely will
never get then merged in.

Thanks. For some reason it was missing in both of my inboxes. Most
likely it was dropped by the corporate spam bot. But I am wondering
how come Kbot just removed my gmail address from Cc...

Anyway the report is reasonable. I'll fix it in v3.

So basically you are maintaining the part for which you don't have
neither hw reference manual nor hw instance, right? This isn't easy
task I'd say. I offered my help twice, but you tend to ignore it. Note
I don't expect that accepting the help means immediately merging my
patches in. They still need to go through the review process.

I would have agreed with you if we didn't have the series tested on
other than mine hardware and haven't had any review comment posted so
far. But the patchset has been available for review for quiet a while.
During that time it was tested on another platform and even got RB
tags from a person having HW instances and reference manuals.

Isn't Manivanna review and tests enough? Isn't me having a bunch of
DWC PCIe hw manuals and testing on at least one DWC PCIe IP-core
instance enough?

If not what do you suggest then? There is no dedicated DWC maintainer
for the generic DWC PCIe bits, the patchset has been hanging out on
review for about two months, and you are going to be away for the next
two months. Waiting for two more months until someone gets to appear
and finds a time to test it out? Really, four months for just 13
patches seems too much.

What I can suggest in this matter is to resend the series today with
all the depended platforms mailing lists in Cc (shall I explicitly add
the maintainers too?). If no serious problem reported until Wednesday
and if I fixed all the reported notes/comments until then, you get to
merge the patchset(s) in. What do think about this?

As I see it this is the main reason of all the arguing above. I think
that there was enough feedback for all the patchsets during the last
two months. You say there wasn't.
