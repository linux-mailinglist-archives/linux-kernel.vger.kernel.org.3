The third version of the patch is the most close in structure
to the proposed protocol. And until the protocol is standardized and
implemented on problematic firmware, I think, it remains the better
solution in terms of simplicity and further porting to the new
protocol.

It is desirable to get the issue resolved, and make the kernel stricter
comply to the spec, without waiting for the new API implementation.
And later, switch the kernel to be using the protocol with
subsequent patches as soon as it gets usable.

So, is there a chance for these patches to be accepted in current
form, or with some modifications?

Thanks,
