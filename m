Fine to me, although not sure whether you need to mention key servers.  We Intel
guys has some first impression of what does "key servers" mean mainly because we
defined some use cases around here using attestation.  However for other people
"key servers" can be very generic and may not be the case we defined.

I think we should use 1.0.  Attestation is a essential part for TDX, which means
it must be included in TDX1.0, therefore it doesn't make sense to use TDX1.5 to
reference it.

Actually this is the kernel memory, but not user memory.  Otherwise
virt_to_phys() doesn't make sense.  You copied the user data to kernel memory in
the last patch.  So whether user memory is aligned doesn't matter, and in last
patch, you have guaranteed the alignment is met during kernel memory allocation.

Anyway like you said the TDCALL will fail if alignment doesn't meet, so I guess
is fine.
