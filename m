Dammit. Now you spilled the beans. :)

It does not matter much. INTx via IOAPIC is different anyway because
INTx is shared so it's unclear from which device it originates.

On baremetal it should just work once ARM is converted over. No idea
about guests. Marc should know.

IR unfortunately does not allow masking, but we surely can come up some
emergency button to press when e.g. an interrupt storm is detected.
