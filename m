And what do you think provides this clock frequency? Do you believe it
comes out of thin air? No, the driver doesn't use a clock, because it
*assumes* the clock feeding the counter is enabled at all times.

Does it mean such clock doesn't exist?

Really? And you have of course audited all possible firmware
implementations (the bootloader, for example, which would *enable*
this clock) and other operating systems than Linux that use the same
DT and run on the same HW?

The kernel tree unfortunately serves as a repository for all the DTs,
including for payloads other than Linux.

Again: clock frequency and clock are not the same thing.

My position on this sort of change remains. Blindly changing existing
DTs based on a warning provided by a tool that totally ignores the
reality of what is out there is not acceptable.
