Right; so not having seen the patches due to Madhaven's email being
broken, I can perhaps less appreciated the crazy involved.

What Josh said; please use/extend ORC.

I really don't understand where all this crazy is coming from; why does
objtool need to do something radically weird for ARM64?

There are existing ARM64 patches for objtool; in fact they have recently
been re-posted:

 https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20220407120141.43801-1-chenzhongjin@huawei.com

The only tricky bit seems to be the whole jump-table issue. Using DWARF
as input to deal with jump-tables should be possible -- exceedingly
overkill, but possible I suppose. Mandating DWARF sucks though, compile
times are so much worse with DWARVES on :/

Once objtool can properly follow/validate ARM64 code, it should be
fairly straight forward to have it generate ORC data just like it does
on x86_64.
