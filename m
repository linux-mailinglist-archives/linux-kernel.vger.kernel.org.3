06 ima: Move policy related variables into ima_namespace

05 ima: Move IMA's keys queue related variables into ima_namespace

04 ima: Move delayed work queue and variables into ima_namespace


06 requires the ima_namespace parameter to be passed into 
process_buffer_measurement(). The problem was ima_process_queued_keys() 
that needs to pass the namespace but it's probably sufficient to use 
&init_ima_ns there as the ima_namespace parameter, which would allow to 
drop 05 and 04.
