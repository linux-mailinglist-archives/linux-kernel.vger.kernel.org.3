It is really hard to help you out without any actual data. The idea was
though to use the low limit protection to adaptively configure
respective memcgs to reduce refaults. You already have data about
refaults ready so increasing the limit for often refaulting memcgs would
reduce the trashing.

That would require A to be without controllers which is not possible due
to hierarchical constrain.

One way to achieve that would be shaping the hierarchy the following way
	    root
	/         \
no_memcg[1]      memcg[2]
||||||||         |||||
app_cgroups     app_cgroups

with 
no_memcg.subtree_control = ""
memcg.subtree_control = memory

no?

You haven't really described why you need per application freezer cgroup
but I suspect you want to selectively freeze applications. Is there
any obstacle to have a dedicated frozen cgroup and migrate tasks to be
frozen there?
