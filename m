I second Jiri here.

Saving lines in drivers is not that important compared with all removing 
all the variants of the same thing that have crept there over the years.

I suspect the main reason for the variants is that everybody just used 
other drivers as examples and therefore we've a few "main" variant 
branches depending on which of the drivers was used as an example for the 
other. That is hardly a good enough reason to keep them different and as 
long as each driver keeps its own function for this, it will eventually 
lead to similar differentiation so e.g. a one-time band-aid similarization 
would not help in the long run.

Also, I don't understand why you see it unreadable when the actual code is 
out in the open in that macro. It's formatted much better than e.g. 
read_poll_timeout() if you want an example of something that is hardly 
readable ;-). I agree though there's a learning-curve, albeit small, that 
it actually creates a function but that doesn't seem to me as big of an 
obstacle you seem to think.
