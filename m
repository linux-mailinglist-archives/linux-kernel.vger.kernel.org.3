What is the semantic of the resulting policy?

Yes this is common practice I have seen so far.

Do you really need to change the policy itself or only the effective
nodemask? I mean what is your usecase to go from say mbind to preferred
policy?  Do you need any other policy than bind and preferred?

Yes, I do understand that you want to change the node affinity and that
is already possible with cpuset cgroup. The existing constrain is that
the policy is hardcoded mbind IIRC. So you cannot really implement a dynamic
preferred policy which would make some sense to me. The question is how
to implement that with a sensible semantic. It is hard to partition the
system into several cgroups if subset allows to spill over to others.
Say something like the following
	root (nodes=0-3)
       /    \
A (0, 1)     B (2, 3)

if both are MBIND then this makes sense because they are kinda isolated
(at least for user allocations) but if B is PREFERRED and therefore
allowed to use nodes 0 and 1 then it can deplete the memory from A and
therefore isolation doesn't work at all.

I can imagine that the all cgroups would use PREFERRED policy and then
nobody can expect anything and the configuration is mostly best effort.
But it feels like this is an abuse of the cgroup interface and a proper
syscall interface is likely due. Would it make more sense to add
pidfd_set_mempolicy and allow sufficiently privileged process to
manipulate default memory policy of a remote process?
