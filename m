Got it. Makes sense.

I think you are talking about the following command, right?

setpci -s <Dev ID> ECAP0001+0x30.w=0x1

If yes, my previously modified instructions already removed it. So
no confusion.

To summarize,

In your case, you have controlled both register read/write of Root
error status register to simulate the interrupt with only multi
ERR_COR bit set.

In my case, I have attempted to simulate it without changing the
default behavior of aer_irq() in the kernel.

Both seem ok to me. Although my personal preference is to trigger
the error without changing the code behavior, if both you and Bjorn
prefer to revert to old instructions, I will fix this in the next version.
