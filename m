I know what FHCTL is, but thank you anyway for the explanation, that's appreciated.
In any case, this not being a *mandatory* component doesn't mean that when it is
enabled it's not changing the way we manage the PLLs..........

I disagree: when we want to use FHCTL, we effectively hand-over PLL control from
APMIXEDSYS to the Frequency Hopping controller - and we're effectively replacing
the set_rate() logic of clk-pll.

> current set_rate method in clk-pll changes PLL register setting directly. Another

...and of course, if we change that, we're effectively mutating the functionality
of the MediaTek clk-pll driver and please understand that seeing a clear mutation
in that driver is a bit more human-readable.

Besides, this makes me think about one question: is there any instance in which,
when FHCTL rate setting fails, we fall back to direct register writes?

I don't think that this is feasible because we have a register in FHCTL that
effectively hands over control to it, so direct register writes should not work
when the PLL is not under APMIXEDSYS control, but I'm asking just to be extremely
sure that my understanding is right.

> We will set some PLL's frequency be controlled

Another question: is this also changing on a per-board basis?

(note: the pll names in the example are random and not specific to anything)

Example: board A wants FHCTL on MMPLL, TVDPLL, MPLL, but *shall not* hand over
                  NNAPLL, MFGPLL
          board B wants FHCTL on NNAPLL, TVDPLL but *shall not* hand over MMPLL

Granted that the two A, B boards are using the same SoC, can that ever happen?

The perms param seems to be about:
  * Enabling debug (but you're not providing any way to actually use debugging
    features, so what's the point?)
  * Handing over PLL control to FHCTL for hopping (can be as well done with
    simply using a different .set_rate() callback instead of a flag)
  * Enabling/disabling Spread Spectrum Clocking (and I think that this is a
    legit use for flags, but if it's just one flag, you can as well use a
    bool and manage this with a devicetree param like "enable-ssc")

That said, I think that the current way of enabling the FHCTL is more complicated
than how it should really be.

Thing is, I don't get why you think that adding SSC to clk-pll would complicate it
so much... it's really just a few register writes and nothing else, so I really
don't see where the problem is, here.

Another issue is that this driver may be largely incomplete, so perhaps I can't
really see the complications you're talking about? Is this the case?

Regarding keeping the FHCTL code in separated files, that's fine, but I would still
integrate it tightly in clk-pll and its registration flow, because - yes, this is
for sure not mandatory, but the main parameters are constant, they never change for
a specific PLL, as they're register offsets, bits and masks (which, again, will
never change as long as we're using the same SoC).

If it's important that the hardware has frddsx_en, sfstrx_en, fhctlx_en *before*
programming df_val/dt_val, then yes.... otherwise, just use writel_relaxed()
everywhere until the last write has to happen.

writel_relaxed(something,	a)
writel_relaxed(something_else,	b)
writel_relaxed(something_more,	a)
writel_relaxed(another_one,	c)
writel_relaxed(blah,		b)
writel(reg_cfg, 		X)

....but having a second look at it, this doesn't make a lot of sense because you
are anyway performing multiple writes to the same `reg_cfg`, so I think that you
can as well aggregate the writes in one and reduce the barriers like that, so
we'd have something like:


u32 pcw_val, val;

/* Important: This assumes that the contents of reg_cfg never change during the
    execution of this programming sequence. */
val = readl_relaxed(regs->reg_cfg);
pcw_val = readl_relaxed(regs->reg_con_pcw) & data->dds_mask;

/* Pause/disable Frequency Hopping controller for reconfiguration */


/* P.S.: can't we use FHCTLx_PAUSE instead of turning off?? */



/* SSC: Disable free-run mode */
val &= ~data->frddsx_en;

/* Disable Soft-start mode */
val &= ~data->sfstrx_en;

/* Disable Frequency Hopping controller */
val &= ~data->fhctlx_en;

writel(val, regs->reg_cfg);

/* **** warning: I'm covering only the enablement flow, not the disablement **** */

/* SSC Slope: Set delta frequency, delta time (df/dt) */
val |= data->df_val & data->msk_frddsx_dys;
val |= data->dt_val & data->msk_frddsx_dts;

/* is it important to write these before DDS?
  * no -> writel_relaxed; yes -> writel
  */
writel_relaxed(val, regs->reg_cfg);

/* Update PLL Toggle value */
writel_relaxed(pcw_val | data->tgl_org, regs->reg_dds);

/* SSC Swing: Calculate upper/lower limits */
updnlmt_val = PERCENT_TO_DDSLMT((readl_relaxed(regs->reg_dds) & data->dds_mask),
				rate << data->updnlmt_shft);
writel_relaxed(updnlmt_val, regs->reg_updnlmt);

/* Hand over PLL control to FHCTL */
fh_set_field(regs->reg_hp_en, BIT(fh_id), 1);

/* Re-Enable SSC and Hopping control */
val |= data->frddsx_en | data->fhctlx_en;
writel(val, data->reg_cfg);


Roughly, that's the idea.
Also, keep in mind that aggregating the writes when possible is already
improving the flow... relaxing R/W is another improvement though... but
beware that technically this is important only in performance paths (so
if this function gets called only very few times in a kernel life, it's
not really important to use _relaxed accessors).

Besides... I don't *really* like seeing the fh_{set, get}_field helpers...
they're confusing at best, and open-coding the R/W makes you able to
aggregate fields in one write without impacting on human readability.

Uhm, I don't think that `struct clk_div_table` is tied to individual clk dividers
in its definition... I mean, it shouldn't be a problem to reuse it in this case...
The advantage of it is that we are able to set a clear idx<->divider relation.

Anyway, if you have strong feelings about not using clk_div_table, it's ok,
unless anyone else has considerations about that.
