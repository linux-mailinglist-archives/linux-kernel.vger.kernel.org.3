We most definitively should have done that but we did not because we
sort of like to maintain as fewer patches as possible against the
mainline kernel, believe it or not. Also, it would have been fun to
explain why we went with our own compatible string to obtain the same
semantics from the kernel as the generic one, but I will stick a pin in
that idea.

Security is not enforced by the kernel here but by a piece of hardware
external to the CPU, that is true of the platforms that prompted the
'restricted-dma-pool' work in the first place by Claire. The compatible
string is irrelevant to that entity. There is no question this is lazy,
that is the whole point actually. The kernel is just communicated a
reserved memory region, if it can support a given behavior and expose a
set of services to do that, great, we leverage that, else we fall back
to another kind that we can also use, albeit differently.

Not quite, I am arguing that in the event that someone thought it was
possible to maintain his/her own notion of backward and forward
compatibility we *could* be supporting this. and with minimal amounts of
code to the kernel.

The kernel is not a trusted entity in the security model revolving
around the 'restricted-dma-pool' anyway which is why it is told where
these reserved memory regions are defined, and does not decide where to
place them. If the aperture is not set-up properly there is no DMA
to/from that region period so the results are pretty clear: you do not
get your device to work. Whether the kernel thinks that region is a
device-private CMA pool or a device-private SWIOTLB pool is largely
irrelevant in the security model that is a kernel mechanism on how you
want to leverage the region.

I suppose your concern is that if we accept my patch, one could build a
kernel with CONFIG_DMA_RESTRICTED_POOL turned off to obtain a device
private CMA pool instead of a truly restricted DMA pool, then the
hypervisor allocates from that area and put sensitive stuff in there,
but later on we let a malicious VM-owned PCIe VF or actual PF DMA from
that location and we exfiltrate out of that location?

That exists today however as soon as an un-trusted DTB can be passed to
that hypervisor, so what is new here that I am missing? If you use the
example I provide in the patch, and given how the code is structured and
the link order, you will get a device private CMA pool instead of a
restricted DMA pool because kernel/dma/contiguous.c will match that
entry before kernel/dma/swiotlb.c (if built) does. Similarly if I can
mangle the DTB passed to the kernel to substitute "restricted-dma-pool'
with 'shared-dma-pool' I would obtain a different behavior for the
kernel than originally intended. The point though is that there should
be adequate security enforced around the reserved memory region in a way
that is orthogonal to the kernel.

Anyway, I thought this might be acceptable, I would like to hear from
others just in case, but will not pursue this router anymore unless
someone tells me otherwise. Thank you, I guess.
