Currently 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs' won't be decreased when
the group doesn't have any pending requests, while some child group
still have pending requests. The decrement is delayed to when all the
child groups doesn't have any pending requests.

For example:
1) t1 issue sync io on root group, t2 and t3 issue sync io on the same
child group. num_groups_with_pending_reqs is 2 now.
2) t1 stopped, num_groups_with_pending_reqs is still 2. io from t2 and
t3 still can't be handled concurrently.

Fix the problem by decreasing 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs'
immediately upon the weights_tree removal of last bfqq of the group.
