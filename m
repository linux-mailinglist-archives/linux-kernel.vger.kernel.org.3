I should've explained it slightly better. Of course SCMI does great work
when managing the clocks. However, what the intent here is the SCMI
clocks register itself nicely into common clk framework.
I don't intend to change the clock. SCP in my case is invariant source.
Hence, no need for ASL methods. I just want to read given clock and have it
registered in clk framework.
Reason for that is simple, there's a good code in SCMI. I don't
want to create own driver for that. I just have to be able to start SCMI
when only source of hardware information is ACPI/UEFI.

This is still most specific thing I could have found on the internet.
So, to clear up the clouds about my idea.

I have platform with UEFI/ACPI only. I want my clocks to be registered.
So, I use SCMI. The framework needs bindings for proper registration.
Instead using DT approach:

firmware {
	scmi {
		compatible = "arm-scmi";
		/* ... */

		clks: protocol@14 {
			reg = <0x14>;
			#clock-cells = <1>;
		}
	}
}

I add ACPI match table to SCMI code and present it with matching ACPI
tables. It might look like this:

Scope (_SB) {
	Device (ARMSCMI) {
		Name (_HID, "ASCM0001")
		Name (_UID, 0)

		Method (_STA) {
			Return (0xF)
		}

		Device (CLKS) {
			Name (_ADR, 0x14)
			Name (_UID, 0)

			Method (_STA) {
				Return (0xF)
			}
		}
	}
}

Then SCMI registers the clocks protocol and does remaining magic.


Kind regards,
Wojciech.
