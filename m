Hm, so in the sysfs patch you have:

+               This value is 1 if all system memory in this node is
+               capable of being protected with the CPU's memory
+               cryptographic capabilities.

So this says the node is capable - so what is fwupd going to report -
that the memory is capable?

From your previous paragraph above it sounds to me like you wanna
say whether memory encryption is active or not, not that the node is
capable.

Or what is the use case?

So people are supposed to run that fwupd on that new hw to check whether
they can use memory encryption?

That's another hmmm: what systems do not do full system memory
encryption and do only per-node?

From those I know, you encrypt the whole memory on the whole system and
that's it. Even if it is a hypervisor which runs a lot of guests, you
still want the hypervisor itself to run encrypted, i.e., what's called
SME in AMD's variant.

Thx.
