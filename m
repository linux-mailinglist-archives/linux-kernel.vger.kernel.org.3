Well, most recent Allwinner boards indeed have capable LPDDR3 (800 MHz)
or DDR3-1600 (or even higher) chips, but we never got them running at the
full clock speed, and lowering the DRAM frequency is a common kludge to
improve system stability (as in: actually reaching the login prompt).
And we figured that those "more aggressive" timings are quite board
specific, so while 800 MHz might work on your particular board, your
friend's OPi3 might not be as lucky.

Yes, while we run most H6 boards at 744 MHz, the Tanix TX6 requires no
more than 648 MHz, for instance, partly because it has DDR3 (not LPDDR3)
DRAM. Another H6 TV box I have needs an even lower frequency (at least
with the current timing settings).

Yes, and on top of that, also keep in mind that many DRAM controller
registers take timing parameters in terms of clock cycles, but the
actual DDR chips are specified in terms of pico- or nanoseconds. This
means the register values must be calculated and programmed based on
the clock frequency, see [1] for examples in all those ns_to_t()
calls. And just increasing the PLL frequency might now lead to exceeded
specifications, and thus subtle instabilities.

Yes, this DDR3 controller logic is mostly undocumented rocket science,
see [2] in our wiki for just *some* (old!) pieces of information and
the complexity it involved in the past to come to a set of timing
parameters (including the clock frequency) that works stably across
all boards.

That's indeed an interesting topic to explore, though the DE seems to
be already in the top tier in our settings:
