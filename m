So I'm not sure how you want to proceed here.

The platform is quirky, so the quirk for it will need to be added this
way or another.  The $subject patch adds it using the existing
mechanism, which is the least intrusive way.

You seem to be thinking that the existing mechanism may not be
adequate, but I'm not sure for what reason and anyway I think that it
can be adjusted after adding the quirk.

Please let me know what you think.
