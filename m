My patch will still subject the cpus_allowed list to the constraint 
imposed by the current cpuset. It will keep as much of what the user 
specified though. If we are worrying about backward compatibility, maybe 
we can restrict that change in behavior to cgroup v2 only or we can add 
a sysctl parameter to restore old behavior if the user choose to.

Users are now gradually migrating over to cgroup v2 and they do 
understand that there are some changes in behavior when using cgroup v2.

Cheers,
Longman
