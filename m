It is and in hindsight, we maybe should have described the whole
address space and let the OS alloc the config space out of it. But
then again, original OpenFirmware PCI binding reflects what the
firmware discovered AND how it is configured. So specifying where
config space is makes sense.

Bottom line is the binding defines putting the config space region in
'reg', not an iATU region.

Originally, it was for cases where you have a variable number of
entries and can't determine what each entry is. IOW, when you have
optional entries in the middle of required entries. But then everyone
*loves* -names even when not needed or useful such as 'phy-names =
"pcie"' (the phy subsys requiring names was part of the problem there,
but that's been fixed).

No, I think this is just as concise and defines the order too:

reg-names:
  items:
    - const: dbi
    - const: dbi2
    - const: config

Sorry, I don't follow.
