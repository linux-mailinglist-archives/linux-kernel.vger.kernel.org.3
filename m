I am Mrs.carolina dalintin, I currently hold the post as the Audit
Account Manager of our bank in Ouagadougou Branch, Burkina-Faso. I got
your contact from a reliable web directory. After much consideration I
developed the trust on you after one week of fasting and praying. Due
to the trust, I made up my mind to disclose this confidential business
to you.We are in position to reclaim and inherit the sum of
US$15.8Million Dollars without any trouble or hindrance from a dormant
account which remains unclaimed since 7years the owner died. This is a
U.S Dollar=E2=80=99s account and the beneficiary died without trace of his
family to claim the fund.

Upon my personal audit investigation into the details of the account,
I find out that the deceased is from Atlanta America, which makes it
possible for you as a foreigner no matter your country to lay claim on
the balance as the Foreign Business Partner or Extended Relative to
the deceased. Your integrity and trustworthiness will make us succeed
without any risk. Please if you think that the amount is too much to
be transferred into your account, you have the right to ask our bank
to transfer the fund into your account bit by bit after approval or
you double the account. Once this fund is transferred into your
account, we will share the fund accordingly.

50% for me, 40% for you, 10% for any expenses we undergo during the
transaction, If you are interested to do this business without
disappointment or breach of trust, reply with your full details
bellow.

1. YOUR FULL NAME:..........................
2. YOUR CONTACT TELEPHONE NUMBER:...........
3. YOUR AGE:................................
4. YOUR SEX:................................
5. YOUR OCCUPATIONS:........................
6. YOUR COUNTRY AND CITY:...................
7. YOUR PHOTO OR IDENTITY CARD:.............

So that I will guide you on the proper banking guidelines to follow
for the claim. After the transfer, I will relocate to your country for
the sharing of the percentages according to our agreement. Assurance:
Note that this transaction will never in any way harm or foiled your
good post or reputation in your country,because everything will follow
legal process,

I wait patiently to hear from you soon
Yours faithfully,

Mrs:carolina dalintin
