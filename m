Yes, bpf is a good way to fetch these data.
In fact we may also consider impacting on some decisions of scheduler in 
some scenes. But it seems to be a long term work...

"simple sums" is fine because we only use this load when selecting 
partitions, not migrating.

If I understand correctly, do you mean a scene that:
cgroupA has only one thread with full busy load (1024)
cgroup B/C/D have many threads with small load (maybe 100)
There're two CPU partitons:0-3 and 4-7

If A choose 0-3 (we suppose its thread sticking on cpu0), so the load of 
partition 0-3 becomes 1024 because simple sums. So B/C/D will all choose 
partition 4-7. This will be fine since our group balancer is a kind of 
"soft" bind. If we are waking a thread from cgroupB and find there is no 
free cpu in 4-7, we'll fallback to normal path and select other idle cpu 
(i.e., 1-3) if possible.
Otherwise, if there is no idle cpu totally, meaning the whole system is 
busy. The existing load balance mechanism will handle it, and our 
patches only try to switch two tasks if their cache in their own cgroups 
can be closer after migration.

Our aim is to improve performance of apps, so will not limit cpu usage 
strictly. This kind of soft bind also helps to avoid conflicts with 
existing load balance mechanism. We may explain this in document.

We set the interface into cpuset subsys because partition info should 
follow effective_cpus. There may be a problem that we need to get load 
info from cpu subsys, so "cpu" and "cpuset" should be both enabled in 
the same cgroup. Fortunately, this is easy in cgroup-v2. Any other 
conflict do you see?

About "work orthogonally with other kernel features", we've explained 
above. Weights are only used in selecting partitions and we just tend to 
trying pulling tasks to their selected partitions, not force.

Just as out explanation in the last mail, we believe building this in 
userspace is not easy. Because interfaces provided by kernel now is 
inflexible. From the view of cgroup, it is given a binded "cpuset.cpus", 
and all cpus in this range are treated equally, while all cpus out of 
this range are strictly forbidden. The existing cpuset mechanisms do 
help resource limitation and isolation, but may be weak on improving 
perforamce.

So, our idea is, doing this in userspace, which relies on existing 
kernel interfaces, is hard. Only exposing more data to increase 
visibility in userspace is not enough. We need a whole solution from 
collecting data to impacting decisions of the scheduler. Maybe eBPF can 
cover all these works in the future, but it takes long time to develop 
and maybe too much to achieve just dynamic cpu bind.

Thanks.
