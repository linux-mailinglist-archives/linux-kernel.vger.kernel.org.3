Hello Rafael, Bjorn, Mika, Dmitry, Greg,

Thanks a lot for your comments.

But because this property also applies to a root port (only), it only
helps if the device is downstream a PCIe root port. In our case, we
have an internal (wifi) device 00:14.3 (sits on the internal PCI bus
0), so cannot use this.

AIUI, the principal comment I have received here is that this property
needs to be documented somewhere. I agree.

Rafael, do you know if this new property can be added to the ACPI
spec, and if so, how to do so? I'm happy to initiate a process if
someone can point me to, I just hope that publishing a new property to
the ACPI does not have to block this patch.

The other option I was thinking of was to use the same property name
(say "untrusted-device") for both ACPI and device tree platforms, and
document it in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci.txt along
with others. Since there are other properties there that seem to be
used similarly (Mika highlighted some below), perhaps that is an
acceptable solution?

I had one last question on the property name itself. I was trying to
understand why a property might have 2 names i.e. "external-facing"
for DT and "ExternalFacingPort" in ACPI? Are there any naming
convention requirements that require ACPI and DT property names to be
different? Is "untrusted-device" an acceptable ACPI property name?

Thanks & Best Regards,

Rajat
