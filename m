checkpatch-only patches are something which I will tend to just
ignore.  (Even if the changes are correct, which they are not in this
case).

In addition to all of the other reasons why such drive-by checkpatch
patches are frowned upon, I would appreciate it if the code paths that
are changed are actually *tested*, at which point you might have
noticed that your changes werenn't doing the right thing.

(BTW I'll also note that the code involved that is almost never
enabled --- the developer would need to manually insert a "#define
DX_DEBUG" at the beginning of the fs/ext4/namei.c source file for the
code to be enabled.  It's only intended to be used by developers who
are doing surgery to the htree code.)
