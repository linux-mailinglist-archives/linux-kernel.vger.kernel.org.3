Strictly speaking, we don't keep APIs with no users. Perhaps removing or 
threatening to remove would spur on some work in your overlay issues 
list. :)

Yes, the intent is it would work for either.

Another usecase I have in mind are USB to serial chips with downstream 
GPIOs, I2C, SPI, etc. where you want to describe downstream devices. And 
then you plug in more than 1...

Yes.

The card would not be described, but the PCI host bridge would likely 
be and that may be where the conflict is. Though I think PCI hosts are 
described differently from devices that end up with a fwnode handle in 
ACPI. 

My current thinking is the whole PCI bus structure from the card 
device up the tree needs to be created in the base DT. Maybe we could 
create just a fake parent for the device and avoid the above issue, but 
I'd guess that would just create other issues.

I think we'd need something where ever device fwnode ptrs are getting 
set. Not entirely sure yet.

Yes, and I've had a call about it in the 'system DT' call.
