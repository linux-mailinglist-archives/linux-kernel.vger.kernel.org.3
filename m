Looking at the source for Vikash's first email in this thread, I see:
"Content-Type: text/plain", so I don't think that was the issue. Also,
the patch was sent using git-send-email: "X-Mailer: git-send-email
2.6.2".

Is there a way to find out exactly why that email might have prompted
the mailing list to drop it?

Thank you!
