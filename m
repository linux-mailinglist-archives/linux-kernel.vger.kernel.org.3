BAD_RES_STATE       | 0x7EA02D |  2error_qp/2reset: invalid qp number.
This is the source of the resource leak, all others are failing as side
effect to this.

This is due to mlx5_ib trying to unload on the vf, most likely due to this patch
doing sriov_disable() on PF flr, and 2 seconds later the PF driver sees that flr
and starts the recovery see below [1]

I think you are doing something that wrecks the VF pci access, where
the FW can't properly find the resource in the VF host memory and then
causes the domino effect...

PF driver detects the FLR here or at least some fatal error on the pci, 
but below you can clearly see the VF "mlx5_core 0000:01:00.2" is still
trying to unload, which means sriov_disable hasn't complete ! So why did
the PF FLR already before SRIOV is clearly disabled?
The only conclusion is some sort of error happening on the PCI due to the
change in behavior of sriov_disable(), which can explain the AER in the next
line :)

VF is still having hard time unloading due to the invalid QP above in the
