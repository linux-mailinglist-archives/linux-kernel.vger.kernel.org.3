Agreed on the config part.

Yes I have seen this.

Why ? Are you suggesting that we shouldn't present the hardware cluster
to the topology because of the above reason ? If so, sorry that is not a
valid reason. We could add login to return NULL or appropriate value
needed in cpu_clustergroup_mask id it matches MC level mask if we can't
deal that in generic scheduler code. But the topology code can't be
compromised for that reason as it is user visible.

Correct and I see no problems as it matches what the hardware is. So I am
not expecting any change in any cpumasks there as they all are aligned with
the hardware.

Why is that a problem ? If so, blame hardware and deal with it as we have to
ðŸ˜„ as usual we get all sorts of topology.

That was complete non-sense and wrong. Boot and check in ACPI mode.

We just need to deal with that. How is that dealt today with ACPI. My
changes are making these aligned with ACPI. If something is broken as
per you understanding with ACPI, then that needs fixing. The topology
presented and parsed by ACPI is correct and we are aligning DT with that.
There is no question on that.

But that change also introduced cluster masks into the topology which again
aligns with my changes.

Sure I can agree with that if Juno ACPI is not broken. But I am sure it is
broken based on your argument above. If it is, that needs fixing and this
series just gets topology parsing in both ACPI and DT aligned, nothing
more or nothing less. In the process it may be introducing clusters, but
if it is not dealt correctly in ACPI, then it won't be in DT too and needs
fixing anyways.
