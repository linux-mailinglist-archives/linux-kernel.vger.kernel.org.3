Have you found any reports of issues other than on the SiFive HiFive
Unmatched?  I poked around a little and didn't see any.  I considered
suggesting that this go in arch/riscv unless we see the problem
elsewhere, but I guess it's maybe not worth that.

Interesting that there's a PI7C9X2G304 involved, since
quirk_enable_clear_retrain_link() is also for Pericom devices.
But that relates to Downstream Ports, and the PI7C9X2G304 is the
Upstream Port in this case, so I suppose it's just coincidental.

The commit log has more detail than necessary, so the specifics of
what the quirk does (basically the last paragraph) get lost.  This
link could be moved to the commit log for the background.  You
previously included a URL for a u-boot change; can you include that
URL as well?

Use pci_is_pcie(), pcie_capability_read_word(), etc.

If retraining failed, I think we should just return here.  We will
skip the code below anyway, but this would be more obvious:

  if (!(lnksta & PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_DLLLA)) {
    pci_inf(..., "failed");
    return;
  }

I don't think it's really necessary to log success.

We rely on PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS and PCI_EXP_LNKCTL2_TLS having the same
encoding in the same bits.  Enough to force a reviewer to
double-check, but it looks like it *is* safe.
