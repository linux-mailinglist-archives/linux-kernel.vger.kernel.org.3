Yes, exactly. For our usecase I noticed the swap backend is used up,
but there is no writeback from zswap to swap backend at all. The
bright side is it may mean the compression ratio is high for our
workload, but the disk space is actually wasted.

I was thinking about this too, but it seems not easy since the swap
slot on swap backen is allocated when the page is added to swap, but
not entry on zswap since zswap is just a cache and invisible to
vmscan. If we have separate entries for zswap and swap backend, it
would be complicated to convert zswap entries to swap backend entries
since we may have to traverse rmap to find all the PTEs mapped to
zswap entry in order to convert them to swap backend entry.
