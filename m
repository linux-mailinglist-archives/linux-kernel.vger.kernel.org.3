I'm sorry, I think the current form of the test reveals an unexpected
behavior of reclaim and silencing the test is not the way to go.
Although, I may be convinced that my understanding is wrong.

Up until here, we're on the same page.

Here, I'd like to stress that the event itself is just a messenger (whom
my original RFC patch attempted to get rid of). The problem is that if
the sibling with recursive protection is active enough to claim it, it's
effectively stolen from the passive sibling. See the comparison of
'precious' vs 'victim' in [1].

The problem is how the unused protection came to be (voluntarily not
consumed vs reclaimed).

Exactly.

The obvious fix is at the end of this message, it resolves the case I
posted earlier (with memory_recursiveprot), however, it "breaks"
memory.events:low accounting inside recursive children, hence I'm not
considering it finished. (I may elaborate on the breaking case if
interested, I also need to look more into that myself).

This selftest has two ±equal workloads in siblings, however, if their
activity varies, it can end up even opposite (the example [1]).

I think it's still useful, to check the behavior when inherited vs
explicit siblings coexist under protected parent.
Actually, the second case of all siblings having the inherited
(implicit) protection is also interesting (it seems that's that I'm
seeing in my tests with the attached patch).

+Cc: Chris, who reasoned about the SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX rounding vs too high
priority (too low numerically IIUC) [2].

Subject: [RFC PATCH] mm: memcg: Do not overreclaim SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX from
 protected memcg
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This was observed with memcontrol selftest/new LTP test but can be also
reproduced in simplified setup of two siblings:

	`parent .low=50M
	  ` s1	.low=50M  .current=50M+ε
	  ` s2  .low=0M   .current=50M

The expectation is that s2/memory.events:low will be zero under outer
reclaimer since no protection should be given to cgroup s2 (even with
memory_recursiveprot).

However, this does not happen. The apparent reason is that when s1 is
considered for (proportional) reclaim the scanned proportion is rounded
up to SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX and slightly over-proportional amount is
reclaimed. Consequently, when the effective low value of s2 is
calculated, it observes unclaimed parent's protection from s1
(ε-SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX in theory) and effectively appropriates it.

What is worse, when the sibling s2 has more (memory) greedy workload, it
can repeatedly "steal" the protection from s1 and the distribution ends
up with s1 mostly reclaimed despite explicit prioritization over s2.

Simply fix it by _not_ rounding up to SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX. This would have
saved us ~5 levels of reclaim priority. I.e. we may be reclaiming from
protected memcgs at relatively low priority _without_ counting any
memory.events:low (due to overreclaim). Now, if the moderated scan is
not enough, we must bring priority to zero to open protected reserves.
And that's correct, we want to be explicit when reclaiming those.
