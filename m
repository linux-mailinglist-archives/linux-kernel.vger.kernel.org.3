Yes at the cost of DT being dumping ground for all the SoC specific firmware
crap. Firmware can be and must be discoverable, no point in dumping it in
DT as it forces DT upgrade every time something changes in the firmware i.e.
it can go out of sync quite quickly.

As I said we don't want DT to be dumping ground for all the not well designed
firmware interface. The whole point of firmware being another piece of
software that can be change unlike hardware makes it fragile to present any
more that what you need in the DT. I see this as one of the example.

Anyways I don't have the final say, I leave it to the DT maintainers.

Sounds to me like more can be pushed to user space as it gets loaded at
runtime.

Worst case I am fine with that as this needs to be one of and future
platforms must get their act right in designing their f/w interface.
