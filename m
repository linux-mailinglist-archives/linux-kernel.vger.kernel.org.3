No disagreement, however being able to fully remove and load the module again ensures that you bring the hardware and software in a sane state every time, i.e.: it does help find actual bugs in either implementations. It's also a faster turn around time if you are working on that specific subsystem in avoid rebooting the kernel needlessly (that puts a lot of faith into not crashing the kernel, still).
