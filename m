No problem, I won't send out v3 until we've finished the discussion and
have consensus. I'll assume that the discussion on whether or not there is
a leak will continue on the thread you linked to above, so I won't comment
on it here.

Correct, as I've understood it, klp_for_each_*_safe() should only iterate
over the objects that have been added to the patch and klp_object's lists,
and thus for which kobject_init() has been invoked. So if we fail a check
on 'struct klp_object' N, then we'll only iterate over the first N - 1
objects in klp_for_each_*_safe().

Not sure I quite follow. We have to do NULL checks for obj->funcs at some
point, and per Josh's suggestion it seems cleaner to do it outside the
critical section, and before we actually invoke kobject_init(). Apologies
if I've misunderstood your point.

Ack!

Ack, no problem, I'll wait until we're all in alignment. Thanks, Petr and
Josh for taking a look at the patch.

David
