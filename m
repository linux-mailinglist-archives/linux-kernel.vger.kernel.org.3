Sorry, I haven't easy reproducible testcase on hand, maybe I could try to
make one to simulate the production environment later.

We also use kpatch-build for some patches too, but for some other patches,
which need to add new members to some struct type, or fix some kernel function
bugs, we may need to rewrite the source patch to make a livepatch module.

There are some types that don't need per-task consistency or even can replace
the old functions when tasks stack in the old functions. We may want to use
"force" transition in case load process timeout.

Thanks.
