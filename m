OK.  So this patch actually has nothing in particular to do with AER.
It's about making _OSC apply to *all* devices below a host bridge,
even those below a VMD.

This is slightly ambiguous because while "_OSC applies to the entire
hierarchy originated by a PCI Host Bridge" (PCI Firmware spec r3.3,
sec 4.5.1), vmd.c creates a logical view where devices below the VMD
are in a separate hierarchy with a separate domain.

The interpretation that _OSC applies to devices below VMD should work,
as long as it is possible for platform firmware to manage services
(AER, pciehp, etc) for things below VMD without getting in the way of
vmd.c.

But I think one implication of this is that we cannot support
hot-added VMDs.  For example, firmware that wants to manage AER will
use _OSC to retain AER control.  But if the firmware doesn't know how
VMDs work, it will not be able to handle AER for devices below the
VMD.
