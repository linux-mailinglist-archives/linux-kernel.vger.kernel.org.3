Yeah, this is the part which I think is really silly.

OSes, in their execution lifetime, can - erroneously or not - but it
happens pretty often in real life, touch some unrelated memory. And this
has never been a big deal - #PF, that's it.

But now they don't even get a chance to correct their mistake - VMEXIT,
die.

load_unaligned_zeropad() is just one case.

Imagine the user loads some buggy driver in the guest and that driver
starts doing stray memory accesses through a wild pointer into the
fields. Guest dies immediately.

Dunno bit it all feels a bit too harsh and unfriendly to me.

Sure, if that user is really unlucky, those stray accesses can kill
his OS on baremetal too. So maybe you could argue here that such stray
accesses are actually a good thing. :)

All I know is, there should be a more resilient way to handle those.

Yeah, I believe this needs to be dealt with anyway, for SNP at least.
But on AMD it would simply cause an exception and it'll be handled in
the #VC thing. And there's some ugly code to deal with the gap too.

I like that. This should've been the default from the get-go. Oh well,
what's it called in English, hindsight is 20 20...?

I think you should push for the bestest solution and one day we can kill
those ugly workarounds.

Thx.
