This doesn't tell me what the advantage of this patch is, since I
don't think *this* patch uses heap allocation.

As far as I can tell, this particular patch doesn't improve safety or
readability, so "convert X to Y even though we don't use any fancy Y
features" is a pointless message.

But if printbufs are better than seq_buf overall, and converting this
gets us closer to the goal of removing seq_buf completely, that's a
perfectly acceptable reason.  Just say that.
