Supporting these devices in Linux in ACPI mode would involve
reimplementing the PEP subsystem, and reimplementing PEP drivers for
all these QCOM peripherals to manage the probing and the power states.
I don't think this is realistic at all, and a huge waste of
engineering effort otherwise.

It is also orthogonal to the discussion, as far as I understand: ACPI
is not telling the system whether or not these TZ services should be
used instead of EFI runtime calls.

So I think this is a reasonable way to expose these EFI services,
although I am not thrilled about the fact that it is needed.
Surprisingly, Microsoft also supports this model both on x86 and arm64
for platforms that keep their variables on eMMC (or any other kind of
storage that sits behind a controller that cannot be shared between
the OS and the firmware). So if we agree that we will support these
systems as best we can, supporting EFI variables at runtime is
something that we should support as well. (Note that I am not
convinced about the latter point myself: on many systems, the EFI
variable store is used precisely once, when GRUB gets installed and
its path added to the boot order, so if we could find a way to
streamline that without EFI runtime services, the story around why EFI
runtime services are important becomes quite weak)

As for the use of efivars_register(): I think this is reasonable, and
the way these patches use it is exactly why it exists in the first
place. Do not that a substantial overhaul of efivars is queued up in
efi/next, although I suspect those changes do not conflict with this
series.
