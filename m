Right, that is a good point. I don't see a logical use case where a trip 
point will be set below or above the previous or the next one, so the 
order should be kept. However, strictly speaking, nothing prevents that 
so I guess we need to reorder the trips when one is changed. It should 
be a one line call.

There won't be any benefit ATM. The get_trip_temp/type/hyst ops are 
called all over the place. If we create a second sorted trip point array 
and use it in the core code, then all those ops should be replaced to 
use the sorted array instead of addressing the private trip structure. A 
big deal in terms of changes.

If we don't do the ops changes, then it is simpler to have an array of 
index->trip id and the impact is small.

But I agree we should have a sorted trip array per thermal zone and stop 
using the ops->get_trip_temp|type|hyst. That is part of the work I'm 
doing in parallel to cleanup the thermal-of and I've the plan to migrate 
all the sensors to use the struct thermal_trip instead of private data. 
 From there we will be able to get rid of the get_trip[*] and the sorted 
trip indexes array.

All these changes are not feasible in the short term. I would like to 
keep the indexes trip array approach to fix the trip cross events which 
is broken right now and then go forward with the struct thermal_trip 
changes and the thermal-of cleanups I've sent last week.

Does it sound reasonable ?
