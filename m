Sorry, I've totally lost track of where we are with this.  I guess the
object is to save/restore L1SS state.

And there are two problems that aren't understood yet?

  1) Lukasz's 01:00.0 wifi device didn't work immediately after
  resume, but seemed to be hot-added later? [1]

  2) The 00:14.0 Root Port L1SS capability was present before
  suspend/resume but not after? [2,3]

I thought Lukasz's latest emails [4,5] indicated that problem 1) still
happened and presumably only happens with Vidya's patch, and 2) also
still happens, but happens even *without* Vidya's patch.  Do I have
that right?

If adding the patch causes 1), obviously we would need to fix that.
It would certainly be good to understand 2) as well, but I guess if
that's a pre-existing problem, ...

Bjorn
