Thanks for reminding. I'm clear now.

Thank you for your answer.

I'm not sure if I understood this in a right way... Did you mean I 
should modify the subject of this mail/patch?

Hi Ulf,
As to dropping REQ_FUA, I don't know if it is a good idea, but generally 
we are facing three possible situations:

1. If both cache and reliable-write are available, both REQ_FUA and 
REQ_FLUSH can be supported at the same time. In this case, with 
available cache, the behavior of reliable-write is to write eMMC while 
skipping cache, which is consistent with the current kernel's definition 
of REQ_FUA. What's more, most eMMCs now support both cache and 
reliable-write command.
2. If only reliable-write is available, REQ_FUA should not be supported, 
which is consistent with the current standard in another way. But I 
don't think eMMCs that only support reliable-write can be easily found 
nowadays.
3. If only cache is available, we just use REQ_FLUSH. It is not in 
conflict with keeping REQ_FUA.

Maybe, is it more reasonable to reserve FUA and use if/else to pick it 
up or down, considering the compatibility? I mean, in most cases, FUA 
and FLUSH are complementary. So it seems more feasible with branch to 
choose.
