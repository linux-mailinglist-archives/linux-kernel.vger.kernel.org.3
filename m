Greetings my good friend

  I have a proposal for you, this however is not mandatory nor will I
in any manner compel you to honor against your will. I am Mr Nnizar
Rokban, a former executive director with Arab Tunisian Bank here in
Tunis; I retired A year and 7 months ago after putting in 28 years of
meticulous service. During my days with Arab Tunisian Bank, I was the
personal account officer and one of the financial advisers to Mr. Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali the past Tunisian President who died on self exile
at Saudi Arabia. During his tryer period he instructed me to move all
his investment in my care which consists of US$115M and 767KG of gold
out of the Gulf States for safe keeping; and that I successfully did
by moving US$50M to Madrid Spain, US$50M to Dubai United Arab Emirate,
US$15M to Ouagadougou and 767KG of gold to Acra Ghana in West Africa
as an anonymous deposits, so that the funds will in no way to be
traced to him. He has instructed me to find an investor who would
stand as the beneficiary of the fund and the gold; and claim it for
further investment.

Consequent upon the above, my proposal is that I would like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the beneficiary of this fund and the gold
which I have successfully moved outside the country and provide an
account overseas where this said fund will be transferred into. It is
a careful network and my voluntary retirement from the Arab Tunisian
Bank is to ensure a hitch-free operation as all modalities for you to
stand as beneficiary and owner of the deposits has been perfected by
me. Mr. Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali will offer you 20% of the total
investment if you can be the investor and claim this deposits in
Spain, Dubai, Ouagadougou and Accra Ghana as the beneficiary.

Now my questions are:-

1. Can you handle this transaction?
2. Can I give you this trust?

Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible so that I can
give you more details regarding this transaction. Finally, it is my
humble request that the information as contained herein be accorded
the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.

I expect your urgent response if you can handle this project.
you can contact me in my emailaddress

Regards,
Mr Nnizar Rokban
