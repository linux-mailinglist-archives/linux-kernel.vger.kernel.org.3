The interface you're proposing is not really extensible, so we'll likely need to
introduce a new interface like memory.reclaim_ext very soon. Why not create
an extensible API from scratch?

I'm looking at cgroup v2 documentation which describes various interface files
formats and it seems like given the number of potential optional arguments
the best option is nested keyed (please, refer to the Interface Files section).

E.g. the format can be:
echo "1G type=file nodemask=1-2 timeout=30s" > memory.reclaim

We can say that now we don't support any keyed arguments, but they can be
added in the future.

Basically you don't even need to change any code, only document the interface
properly, so we can extend it later without breaking the API.

Actually there are examples (e.g. sys_bpf), but my only point is to make
the API extensible, so maybe syscall is not the best idea.

I'd add the root level interface from scratch: the code change is simple
and it makes sense as a feature. Then likely we don't really need another
system-level interface at all.

Thanks!
