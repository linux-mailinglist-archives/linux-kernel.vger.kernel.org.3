True both are supplied by the end-user, but the trust models are
different.  In one case the certificates are coming indirectly from
firmware, while in the other case the certificates would be limited to
certificates signed by the initial firmware certificates.  Loading only
root-CA signing key certificates onto the "machine" keyring highlights
and enforces the different types of trust.

This paragraph refers to keys on the "builtin_trusted_keys" keyring. 
The concept would need to be expanded to include keys on the "machine"
keyring.   Since support for intermediary CA keys isn't required for
the simple "end-user" use case, the motivation  needs to be provided.

thanks,

Mimi
