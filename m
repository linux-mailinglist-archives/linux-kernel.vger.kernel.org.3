If we just leave the selection of the compile time options to the user 
(suggested ones being IMA_WRITE_POLICY

and IMA_READ_POLICY being enabled) we don't need to make any changes.

Choices are for IMA_NS:
1) Leave compile-time options to the user and suggest IMA_WRITE_POLICY and IMA_READ_POLICY
2) Auto-select IMA_WRITE_POLICY and IMA_READ_POLICY for IMA_NS and still remove file for non-IMA_NS case and have the dentry in the ima_namespace
3) Auto-select IMA_WRITE_POLICY and IMA_READ_POLICY for IMA_NS and still remove file for non-IMA_NS case and use global dentry
4) Changing mode bits on the file/inode to avoid having the dentry

for v6 I just leave things as they are and we can then see what we need.
