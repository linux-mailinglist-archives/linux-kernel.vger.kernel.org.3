I don't see Linos patches on mainline. Also, the series included four patches:
[PATCH v3 0/4] Fixes for TPM interrupt handling
[PATCH v3 1/4] tpm: Use a threaded interrupt handler
[PATCH v3 2/4] tpm: Simplify locality handling
[PATCH v3 3/4] tpm: Fix test for interrupts
[PATCH v3 4/4] tpm: Only enable supported irqs

Three of them are relevant for the interrupt problem, which is still present in
mainline, as these patches were refused:
[PATCH v3 1/4] tpm: Use a threaded interrupt handler
[PATCH v3 2/4] tpm: Simplify locality handling
[PATCH v3 3/4] tpm: Fix test for interrupts
