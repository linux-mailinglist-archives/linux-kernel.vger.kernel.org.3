If ima in the future decides to do policy inheritance it can simply
switch from delayed allocation at mount time to allocation at userns
creation time. So we can proceed with lazy allocation without much
problem for now.

In addition what is happening now is in effect policy inheritance, i.e.
each container is bound by the parent ima_ns policy until it decides to
setup its own.

Aside from that the container manager can and should be responsible for
the default ima policy to apply to containers. The default ima policy
can be passed through the spec file, configuration file, or - for the
hardcore people - compiled into the container manager itself. This is
not different from LSMs (e.g. AppArmor, seccomp) where the policy for
each container is generated from a fixed template that was built into
the container manager binary and then written via
/proc/<pid>/attr/current during container setup.

During container setup the process that ultimately calls exec to execute
the payload does all of the required setup work. The setup process
should not be automatically bound by a default policy that gets created
when the userns is created. That will just cause problems during
container setup.
Until the setup process has decided that all preliminary setup steps are
done only the ancestor policy should restrict it.
This is exactly the same for all LSMs and seccomp. They all are usually
setup closely before calling exec. I see no reason for ima to diverge
from this model.
