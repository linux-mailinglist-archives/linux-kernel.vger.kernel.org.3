Yes, I was working on some patches at
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/linux.git/log/?h=wip-keys-fixes
but got distracted by other things, as well as finding the problems with SM2
which will take some time to decide what to do with.  I'll try to get some
patches ready, but there are a lot of things to fix.

You could certainly declare a fixed-length struct, but only sign/verify the used
portion of it.  The fixed-length struct would just be an implementation detail.

Alternatively, you could always sign/verify a fixed-length struct, with any
shorter hashes zero-padded to HASH_MAX_DIGESTSIZE (64 bytes).  This would be
fine if you're confident that hashes longer than 64 bytes will never be used.
(They don't make sense cryptographically, but who knows.)

For future extensibility, you might want to call the 'is_fsverity' field
something like 'hash_type', so it would be like an enum rather than a bool.  I
just used 'is_fsverity' as a minimal example.
