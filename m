It is probably not a sufficient solution, but it is simple. The problem 
with keeping a list of recently updated blkg's is that sequence lock 
does not provide enough synchronization on the read side to guarantee a 
race free reset of the list. It may be doable, but I need to think 
harder on the best way to do it without too much overhead.

Thanks,
Longman
