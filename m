Sorry for the double email.... but I've just realized that this was a bug on
my side!!!!! I am so sorry for raising all this dust.

regmap-mmio has .fast_io = true in its regmap_bus structure, hence, every
syscon user is already using spinlocks. I was doing some tests around and
during that operation I've created a condition in which that got ignored.

We can let this series die.

Apologies.

Regards,
Angelo
