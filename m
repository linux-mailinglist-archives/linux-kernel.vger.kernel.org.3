Not sure how common it is, but I'm aware of systems that have dynamic
access characteristics.  i.e. the bandwidth and latency of a access
to a given memory device will change dynamically at runtime (typically
due to something like hardware degradation / power saving etc).  Potentially
leading to memory in use needing to move in 'demotion order'.  We could
handle that with a per device tier and rank that changes...

Just thought I'd throw that out there to add to the complexity ;)
I don't consider it important to support initially but just wanted to
point out this will only get more complex over time.
