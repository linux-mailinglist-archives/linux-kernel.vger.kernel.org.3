I'm not sure if Qualcomm will still use the "uefisecapp" approach in 10
years, but I don't expect the interface of uefisecapp to change. The
interface is modeled after the respective UEFI functions, which are spec
and thus I don't expect those to change. Also, it seems to have been
around for a couple of generations and it hasn't changed. The oldest
tested is sdm850 (Lenovo Yoga C630), and the latest is sc8280xp
(Thinkpad X13s).

Why not make this behave like a "normal" third-party device? If the
interface ever changes use qcom,tee-uefisecapp-v2 or something like
that? Again, this does not seem to be directly tied to the SoC.

Then again, if you prefer to name everything based on
"qcom,<device>-<soc>" I don't have any strong arguments against it and
I'm happy to change that. I just think it will unnecessarily introduce
a bunch of compatibles and doesn't reflect the interface "versioning"
situation as I see it.

Indeed.

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "lack of probe deferral support".
We have qcom_scm_is_available() and defer probe if that fails. So
deferral works, unless I'm misunderstanding something.

But yes, correct on the other points.

I assume you're referring to tegra_bpmp_get()? Does this correctly
handle PM dependencies? At least as far as I can tell it doesn't
explicitly establish a device link, it only gets a reference to the
device, which doesn't guarantee the presence of a driver. Nor correct PM
ordering. Please correct me if I'm wrong. As far as I know automatic
creation of device links only works with certain props defined in
of_supplier_bindings, right?

So unless I'm wrong there is also a bunch of other stuff that may be
subtly broken. (Again, not a justification to include these changes,
just wondering whether there should be a conscious approach to find and
fix these things... rather than discover them patch-by-patch).

I have another example (that could be improved via a phandle in DT): For
the Surface System Aggregator (in ACPI-land), we have ssam_client_bind().
This function 1) checks if the controller is available and ready, 2) if
it is gets a reference to it, and 3) establishes a device link for
PM-ordering, before 4) returning the reference to that controller to the
client. This combined with deferring probe ensures that we will always
have a valid reference. And since we're in DT-land, we could hook that
up with a phandle reference to SCM and load that instead of having to
use a global static.
