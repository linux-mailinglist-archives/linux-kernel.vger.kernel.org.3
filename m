This patchset is a second one in the series created in the framework of
my Baikal-T1 PCIe/eDMA-related work:

[1: In-progress v4] PCI: dwc: Various fixes and cleanups
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220610082535.12802-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
[2: In-progress v3] PCI: dwc: Add hw version and dma-ranges support
Link: ---you are looking at it---
[3: In-progress v3] PCI: dwc: Add extended YAML-schema and Baikal-T1 support
Link: ---being submitted afterwards---
[4: In-progress v2] dmaengine: dw-edma: Add RP/EP local DMA support
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220503225104.12108-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/

Note it is very recommended to merge the patchsets in the same order as
they are listed in the set above in order to have them applied smoothly.
Nothing prevents them from being reviewed synchronously though.

Originally the patches submitted in this patchset were a part of the series:
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220503214638.1895-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
but due to the reviewers requests the series was expanded to about 30
patches which made it too bulky for a comfortable review. So I decided to
split it up into two patchsets: 2. and 3. in the table above.

Regarding the series content. This patchset is about adding new features
to the DW PCIe core, Root Port and Endpoint drivers. First we suggest to
add a more verbose link-up log message. Really printing link generation
and width would be much more informative than just "link up". Then a
series of IP-core version-related patches go, like using a native FourCC
version representation, adding the IP-core auto-detection, adding a better
structured IP-core version/type interface and finally dropping manual
IP-core version setups from the platforms which are supposed to have it
auto-detected. After that the platform-specific host de-initialization
method is introduced. It's unused in the framework of this patchset but
will be utilized in the next one (see the table above). A series of iATU
optimizations, cleanups and new features goes afterwards. In particular we
suggest to drop some redundant enumerations, add iATU regions size
detection procedure and then use the regions parameters to verify the
requested by the platform iATU ranges/dma-ranges settings. After that the
dma-ranges property support is added for the DW PCIe Host controllers.

Changelog v2:
- Test the error condition first and return straight away if it comes true
  in the link up waiting and link state logging method (@Joe).
- Move the dw_pcie_region_type enumeration removal patch to being applied
  before the IB/OB iATU windows setup simplification patch (@Rob).
- Move the iATU region selection procedure into a helper function (@Rob).
- Rebase from kernel v5.17 onto v5.18-rc3 since the later kernel has
  already DT bindings converted. (@Rob)
- Simplify the iATU region selection procedure by recalculating the base
  address only if the space is unrolled. The iATU viewport base address
  will be saved in the pci->atu_base field.
- Move the IP-core version detection procedure call from
  dw_pcie_ep_init_complete() to dw_pcie_ep_init().
- Add a new patch: "PCI: dwc: Detect iATU settings after getting
  "addr_space" resource."

Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220503225104.12108-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru
Changelog v3:
- Fix pcie-tegra194-acpi.c driver to using the new macros names.
  (@Manivannan)
- Drop in/outbound iATU window size alignment constraint. (@Manivannan)
- Detach this series of patches into a dedicated patchset.
- Rebase onto kernel v5.18.
