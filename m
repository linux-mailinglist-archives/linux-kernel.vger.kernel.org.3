             Greetings,


I have a proposal for you,  however it is not mandatory nor will I in
any manner compel you to honor against your will. I am Assad LBN, a
former executive director with Arab Tunisian Bank here in Tunisia; I
retired A year and 7 months ago after putting in 28 years of
meticulous service. During my days with Arab Tunisian Bank, I was the
personal account officer and one of the financial advisers to Mr. Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali the past Tunisian President in self exile at Saudi
Arabia. During his tryer period he instructed me to move all his
investment in my care which consists of US$115M and 767KG of gold out
of the Gulf States for safe keeping; and that I successfully did by
moving US$50M to Madrid Spain, US$50M to Dubai United Arab Emirate,
US$15M to Burkina Faso and the 767KG of gold to Accra Ghana in West
Africa as an anonymous deposits, so that the funds will in no way to
be traced to him. He has instructed me to find an investor who would
stand as the beneficiary of the fund and the gold; and claim it for
further investment.

Consequent upon the above, my proposal is that I would like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the beneficiary of this fund and the gold
which I have successfully moved outside the country and provide an
account overseas where this said fund will be transferred into. It is
a careful network and my voluntary retirement from the Arab Tunisian
Bank is to ensure a hitch-free operation as all modalities for you to
stand as beneficiary and owner of the deposits have been perfected by
me. Mr. Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali will offer you 20% of the total
investment if you can be the investor and claim these deposits in
Spain and Burkina Faso as the beneficiary.


Now my questions are:-

1. Can you handle this transaction?
2. Can I give you this trust?

Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible so that I can
give you more details regarding this transaction. Finally, it is my
humble request that the information as contained herein be accorded
the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.

I expect your urgent response if you can handle this project.

Email.asad1ibn@gmail.com.
From Assad LBN.
