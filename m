Yes, of_overlay_fdt_apply() was used by one driver.  But that driver
was explicitly recognized as a grandfathered exception, and not an
example for other users.  It was finally removed in 5.18-rc1.

You may have used of_overlay_fdt_apply() in a specific use case at
a specific kernel version, but if you read through the references
I provided you will find that applying overlays after the kernel
boots is a fragile endeavor, with expectations of bugs and problems
being exposed as usage is changed (simple example is that my adding
some overlay notifier unittests exposed yet another memory leak).

The reference that I provided also shows how the overlay code is
being improved over time.  Even with improvements, it will remain
fragile.

Yes, that it is very important that you have described this fact, both
here and in other emails.  Thank you for that information, it does help
understanding the alternatives.

I've hesitated in recommending a specific solution before better
understanding the architecture of your pcie board and drivers, but
I've delayed too long, so I am going to go ahead and mention one
possibility at the risk of not yet fully understanding the situation.

On the surface, it appears that your need might be well met by having
a base devicetree that describes all of the pcie nodes, but with each
node having a status of "disabled" so that they will not be used.
Have a devicetree overlay describing the pcie card (as you proposed),
where the overlay also includes a status of "ok" for the pcie node.
Applying the overlay, with a method of redirecting the target to a
specific pcie node would change the status of the pcie node to enable
its use.  (You have already proposed a patch to modify of_overlay_fdt_apply()
to allow a modified target, so not a new concept from me.)  My suggestion
is to apply the overlay devicetree to the base devicetree before the
combined FDT devicetree is passed to the kernel at boot.  The overlay
apply could be done by several different entities.  It could be before
the bootloader executes, it could be done by the bootloader, it could
be done by a shim between the bootloader and the kernel.  This method
avoids all of the issues of applying an overlay to a running system
that I find problematic.  It is also a method used by the U-boot
bootloader, as an example.

The other big issue is mixing ACPI and devicetree on a single system.
Historically, the Linux devicetree community has not been receptive
to the ides of that mixture.  Your example might be a specific case
where the two can be isolated from each other, or maybe not.  (For
disclosure, I am essentially ACPI ignorant.)  I suspect that mixing
ACPI and devicetree is a recipe for disaster in the general case.

More to come later as I finish reading through the various threads.
