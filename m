I've been trying this on my own Unmatched board, where I often use
network boot. We have also tested with a new-ish U-Boot (2022.01 I
think) with both "pci enum" and not. It has been on our test board
for over a week without an issue.

I will have a look for v4 about changing the WARN_ON() to something
more useful.
