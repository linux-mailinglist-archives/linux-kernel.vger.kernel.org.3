I think the alloc for the msi_msg just needs a GFP_DMA32 flag.
Unfortunately that is done in each driver and would be kind of odd.

The thing is I'm pretty sure the actual address doesn't matter. The
MSI never actually writes to memory but is terminated by the MSI
controller. It just can't be an address you would want to DMA to (such
as driver data allocations). And it needs to account for any bus
translations, which the DMA API conveniently handles.

So maybe it needs to be its own alloc as before but avoiding the leak
and also setting GFP_DMA32. Unless others have ideas.
