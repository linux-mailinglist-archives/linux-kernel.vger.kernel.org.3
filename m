Wow, that driver reinvents so many standard APIs for no apparent reason 
it's not even funny.

Anyway, from a brief look it seemingly already knows how to call the DMA 
API semi-correctly, so WTF that's doing behind an #ifdef, who knows? 
However it's still so completely wrong in general - fundamentally broken 
AArch64 set/way cache maintenance!? - that it looks largely beyond help. 
"Throw CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG at it and cry" is about the extent of 
support I'm prepared to provide for that mess.

Thanks,
Robin.
