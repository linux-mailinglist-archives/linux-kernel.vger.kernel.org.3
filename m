The "lge" compatible is already in the bindings, so it should not be
changed without valid reason. Imagine there is an user-space code
parsing compatibles to adjust some power-management settings to
different models. It would be broken now.

What could be done is to mark it as deprecated and a add new one:
compatible = "lg,hammerhead", "lge,hammerhead", "qcom,msm8974";
This should be safe for user-space and allow transition to common "lg".
