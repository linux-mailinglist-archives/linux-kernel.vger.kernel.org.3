Ahh, I get what you're trying to say now.  But, it still really lacks a
coherent problem statement.  How about this?

	== Problem ==

	A given page of memory can only be accepted once.  The kernel
	has a need to accept memory both in the early decompression
	stage and during normal runtime.

	== Solution ==

	Use a bitmap to communicate the acceptance state of each page
	between the decompression stage and normal runtime.  This
	eliminates the possibility of attempting to double-accept a
	page.

	== Details ==

	Allocate the bitmap during decompression stage and hand it over
	to the main kernel image via boot_params.

	In the runtime kernel, reserve the bitmap's memory to ensure
	nothing overwrites it.

That's a good point.  If the e820 range does a one-way shrink it's
probably fine.  The only problem would be if the bitmap had space for
for stuff past e820__end_of_ram_pfn() *and* it later needed to be accepted.

Would it be worth recording the size of the reservation and then
double-checking against it in the bitmap operations?
