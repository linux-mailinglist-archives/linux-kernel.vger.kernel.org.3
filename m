Ok.  Please work with Prasad to squash these as needed so there are no
regressions along the way.

Yes.  But if qcom starts powering off devices when nvme isn't
expecting it, it sounds like nvme will regress until the patch that
adds nvme support.  That temporary regression is what I want to avoid.
