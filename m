Oh, indeed, that works. I figured that DBI stuff was only for the higher 
registers, not the core PCIe ones. Sounds like a plan then! We might 
still want to set LNKCTL2 though, since there's no point in that 
specifying a higher speed than what we are now claiming the hardware 
supports.

We can drop this patch then, and probably the max-link-speed props in 
the DTs altogether. More stuff in m1n1 is good, makes it easier to keep 
older kernel support with new hardware :)
