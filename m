Could you please help us understand little more about your setup. Is this (sda5)
somehow a backup image saved/restored using e2image?

^^^ looks like these patches might have triggered the check on the backup
superblock if the on-disk s_overhead_cluster doesn't match with in kernel
calculation.

All of the prints above shows the prints coming from ext4_update_backup_sb()
which is getting called during mount from ext4_fill_super() -> ext4_update_overhead()

So, recently I have also been reported with a similar problem, where in filesystem
image which was saved using e2image on v5.17 kernel (with e2fsck 1.45.5 (07-Jan-2020)).
Then on upgrading the kernel to v5.18, when this FS image (via e2image) was mounted
using loop device (or restored to a block device), the above error messages
were observed.

My theory so far is, that somehow the s_overhead_cluster calculation saved on
the disk was not correct (since I guess earlier version of e2fsprog 1.45.5 might
not be storing s_overhead_cluster information on disk durnig mkfs??).
Then on upgrading the kernel, the 3 patches mentioned would recalculate the
sbi->s_overhead for non-bigalloc filesystem during mount and if it doesn't match
the on disk es->s_overhead_cluster value, it will try to update all superblocks
via (ext4_update_overhead())

why CRC checksum failure -
	...Before updating backup superblock it will check the checksum to make sure
	that the superblock backup copy is not corrupt.
	And I guess e2image doesn't stores the backup superblocks while saving the
	image. So those blocks are all zeroed. Hence the superblock checksum problem
	is getting reported with the case which I am seeing it internally.

So, putting down my thoughts here for discussion -

- 1st is this consider a valid usecase to use e2image save/restore of disk image
  (users could backup using "-a" option which will also take the backup of all the FS
  data + critical metadata).

- Given we might use this way of updating backup superblock copies in kernel for
  even other values in future and users could upgrade their kernels but might
  still use older e2fsprogs, does it make sense to provide an option in e2image
  to save copies of backup superblocks too?

- I haven't yet spend much time for a solution for above problem. i.e. What
  should we do for users who might still might take up backup w/o this
  additional option to save backup superblocks. With this kernel thinks that the
  backup superblock is corrupt, since it's checksum doesn't match.
