This is a driver question, which I think is secondary.  If necessary,
we can fix drivers after figuring out what the PCI core should do.

Another possibility is PCIBIOS_MIN_IO.  It's also kind of an ugly
special case, but at least it already exists.  Most arches define it
to be non-zero, which should avoid this issue.

Defining PCIBIOS_MIN_IO would be simple; what would we lose compared
to adding code in pci_bus_alloc_from_region()?
