The main problem here is that Linux does not support hotplugging for the
devices behind non-hotpluggable buses. You need to develop something to
say that the device tree (in terms of hardware) can morph at run-time
transparently to the user. I think the closest one is what FPGA does,
or at least should do.

In either case you need to provide a format that would be suitable for
DT-based as well as ACPI-based platforms.
