I am fine with either approach: a separate interface similar to
memory.reclaim, but dedicated to demotion, or multiplexing
memory.reclaim for demotion with a flag.

My understanding is that with the "demote pages during reclaim"
support, b) is the expected behavior, or more precisely, pages that
cannot be demoted may be freed or swapped out.  This is reasonable.
Demotion-only can also be supported via some arguments to the
interface and changes to demotion code in the kernel.  After all, this
interface is being designed to be extensible based on the discussions
so far.
