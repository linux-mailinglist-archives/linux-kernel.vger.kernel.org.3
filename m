Correct. I picked 2018 because the first devices where using E820
reservations are causing issues (i2c controller not getting resources
leading to non working touchpad / thunderbolt hotplug issues) have
BIOS dates starting in 2019. I added a year margin, so we could make
this 2019.

I see, I presume the idea is to then use DMI to disable E820 clipping
on current devices where this is known to cause problems ?

So for v8 I would:

1. Change the cut-off check to < 2023
2. Drop the DMI quirks I added for models which are known to need E820
   clipping hit by the < 2018 check
3. Add DMI quirks for models for which it is known that we must _not_
   do E820 clipping

Is this the direction you want to go / does that sound right?

Note the DMI list for 3. will initially very likely be incomplete, but
I can ask around for testing once we have settled on this approach
and do one or more follow up patches to extend the list.

Ok, I'll add this for v8.
