Bad start with a deprecated interface :-).

I don't think there is a valid use case for freeing specific vectors. Its
true some are special, IDXD has vector#0 like that. But I expect drivers to
acquire these special vectors  once and never free them until driver 
tear down time.

But there is a need to free on demand, for a subdevice constructed for idxd
pass-through, when the guest is torn down, host would need to free them.
Only growing on demand seems to only catch one part of the dynamic part.

IDXD also allocates interrupt only when the WQ is enabled, and frees when its
disabled.

Since the core is already managing what's allocated and free, requiring
drivers to manage each allocated entries seem hard, while the core can
easily manage it. For IDXD cases, we don't really care which ones of the
IMS is being allocated and freed. It just wants one of the available IMS
entries. The assumption is since the driver would have acquired any special
ones upfront with the alloc_irqs().

If we were to allocate one, the new API can simply return the index
directly to the caller, and they call pci_irq_vector() to get the IRQ
number.

It doesn't *have* to be that all vectors are special. Some of them are
special that they acquired all during driver load time. These are allocated
once and never freed. The rest are for say completion interrupts or such and 
such that go with work queues. These can dynamically be allocated and
freed.

The driver doesn't really care which index it wants or what the next index
should be. But it has to remember the allocated ones so it can pass down
for the free. Maybe the one we did a while back

This has a group handle, and kept adding things to it.

This use case is broken already, the VFIO case sort of assumes things are
growing in sequence. Today it doesn't have a hint on which entry is being
unmasked I suppose. So VFIO simply releases everything, adds N more than
currently allocated. 

If there is a real world need for allocating a
specific vector#50, maybe we should add a alloc_exact() type and core can
check if #50 is still available.

Maybe for MSIx we don't have a need to shrink based on current usage. IMS
requires both grow and shrink. But it might be odd to have 2 domains behave
quite differently.

Cheers,
Ashok
