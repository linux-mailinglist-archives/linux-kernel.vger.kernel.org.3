Do partitions have any significance in hardware, or are they just a
logical concept? Does it matter which compute core / bus replicator /
dma channel a user gets, or are they interchangeable between uses?

Given the top-down resource distribution policy for cgroups, I think
you'd have to have a cgroup subtree where limits for these resources
are exclusively passed to, and maintain the placement of processes in
the appropriate cgroup under this subtree (one per partition +
global). The limit for these resources in all other subtrees under the
root would need to be 0. The only trick would be to maintain the
limit(s) on the global pool based on the sum of the limits for the
partitions to ensure that the global pool cannot exhaust resources
"reserved" for the partitions. If partitions don't come and go at
runtime then that seems pretty straightforward, otherwise I could see
the maintenance/adjustment of those limits as a source of frustration.
