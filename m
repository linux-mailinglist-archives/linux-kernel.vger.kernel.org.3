I am getting 256 bytes for an ECC signature in PKCS#7 format:

	cd src/fsverity-utils
	make
	openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out key.pem
	openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 360
	touch file
	./fsverity sign file file.sig --key=key.pem --cert=cert.pem
	stat -c %s file.sig

Probably you accidentally included the whole certificate in the PKCS#7 message.
That's not required here.

There are definitely problems with PKCS#7, and it does have space overhead.  But
the space overhead is not as bad as you state.
