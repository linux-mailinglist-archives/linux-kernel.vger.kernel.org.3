Yes, I thought this too, OK we agree

I picked the name because it looks like it will primarily contain an
xarray and the API you suggested to query it is idx based. To me that
is a table. A table of msi_desc storage to be specific.

It seems we have some agreement here as your lfunc also included the
same xarray and uses an idx as part of the API, right?

Now I'm a bit confused, what is the idx in the lfunc? 

I think this is language again, I would call idx an artificial table
representation?

Agreed, just trying to be illustrative at a higher level

Okay, so the device must setup the domain because it must provide
information during setup. Makes sense

Up to here is basically what I thought the "message table" would
contain. Possibly a pointer to the iommu_domain too?

Not sure why do we need this?

Lets imagine a simple probe function for a simple timer device. It has
no cdev, vfio, queues, etc. However, the device only supports IMS. No
MSI, MSI-X, nothing else.

What does the probe function look like to get to request_irq()?

Why does this simple driver create something called a 'logical
function' to access its only interrupt?

I think you have the right idea here, just forget about VFIO, the IDXD
use case, all of it. Provide a way to use IMS cleanly and concurrently
with MSI.

Do that and everything else should have sane solutions too.

I will quote you: "Seriously, you cannot make something uniform which
is by definition non-uniform." :)

We will find there is no common stuff here, we did this exercise
already when we designed struct auxiliary_device, and came up
empty.

Can you explain a bit what you see 0 meaning in this idx numbering?

I also don't understand what 'queue relative' means?

This means that a device like IDXD would store the phsical IMS table
entry # in the msi descriptor? What is idx then?

For a device like IDXD with a simple linear table, how does the driver
request a specific entry in the IMS table? eg maybe IMS table entry #0
is special like we often see in MSI?

For the devices I know about there are two approaches for allocating
interrupts. 

Many devices have a few special interrupts at fixed table
indexes. These can only be used for their single purpose. Eg MSI 0 and
1. An example is IRQ 1 signals the device had an error, read the error
reporting MMIO registers.

Then the device has a broad pool of fungible vectors. These are all
interchangeable, any vector can be used with any queue. eg MSI 2->128

A common mode operation is to setup the special vectors first, and
then assign on demand the pool vectors as CPUs are allocated for
use. Basically each CPU gets a vector and then many device objects are
attached to that vector. This scheme gives CPU locality and doesn't
exhaust CPU vectors. As example nvme uses 1 queue per CPU and 1 vector
per queue and userspace tells it how many queues (and thus CPUs) to
consume.

A device like mlx5 may have 1000's of queues and hundreds of sub
devices sharing a single CPU interrupt. This is desirable because we
can quickly run out of interrupts when we are talking about 100's of
concurrent subdevices.

When a "VFIO mdev" gets involved (mlx5 has this already, it is just
called VDPA, don't ask) the same allocator is used by the VFIO part
except VFIO has to request a dedicated MSI. Dedicated is because the
Intel VTx is used to deliver that MSI addr/data directly to the
guest's vAPIC.

When I imagine mlx5 using IMS, I see IMS as a simple extension of the
existing MSI-X vector pool. Every IMS vector is interchangable and the
main PCI driver will apply exactly the same allocation algorithm we
already have today for MSI, just with even more vectors. When VFIO
wants a vector it may get a MSI or it may get an IMS, I don't want to
care.

All of this about logical functions just confuses
responsibilities. The IRQ layer should be worrying about configuring
IRQs and not dictating how the device will design its IRQ assignment
policy or subdevice scheme.

We are already doing this with struct auxiliary_device and other
similar things. I don't see the value to couple the msi_data into the
lifetime model?

I think you have the right core idea, just shrink your thinking of
logical_function to only cover msi stuff and leave the device model to
the other places that already have good mechansims. eg auxiliary device

IMHO this has become hyper focused on the special IDXD VFIO use case -
step back and think about my timer example above - a simple pci_driver
that just wants to use IMS for itself. No queues, no VFIO, no
mess. Just how does it configure and use the interrupt source.

Is it helpful feedback?
