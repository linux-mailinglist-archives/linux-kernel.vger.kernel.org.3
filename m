I agree that max performance level should be treated as upper bound.
Thermal capping help us somewhat to figure out the currently achievable
performance level. Removing disabled boost levels would help too. There
might still be quite a gap between requested and delivered performance
though.

Yes, it won't necessarily be very accurate. I'm just wondering if we can
do better than only taking thermal capping and maybe disabled boost
levels into account? Tracking delivered vs requested performance avoids
the problem of having to deal explicitly with every kind of mechanism
that can reduce delivered performance. Delivered performance can't be
taken as a true upper limit for performance as it might change very
quickly.
