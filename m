I agree with Heinrich: it's just a defconfig change, we're not dropping 
support for SBI-0.1.  The defconfig is generally meant to reflect what 
kernel developers are using, and AFAIK everyone doing upstream 
development moved off the legacy SBI implementations as of a while ago.  
There's some cost associated with supporting the old SBI, it's not like 
this is just some backup calls we're adding.

If vendors are still shipping old firmwares as part of their SDKs that's 
fine, they'll just need to flip on support for it in their configs.  Who 
knows, maybe this will even be the nudge they need to stop shipping 
ancient firmware ;)
