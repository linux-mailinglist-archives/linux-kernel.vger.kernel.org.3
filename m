Yes, this is a bit confusing indeed!

Is it really that rare? Most configurations would use a default setup, so
both MEMCG enabled and without nokmem on cmd line yet the memory
controller is not enabled in their setups.

I agree that this is slightly confusing and undocumented. The first step
would be finding out why we need both outside of the memcg proper.

E.g. it doesn't make much sense to me that count_objcg_event uses the
command line variant when it should be using the dynamic (and more
optimized no branch) variant.

On the other hand pcpu_alloc_chunk seems to be different because it can
be called before the controller is enabled but maybe we do not need to
waste memory before that? Similarly new_kmalloc_cache. I suspect these
are mostly to simplify the code and reduce special casing.

I do not think that saving 9 LOC and sacrifice optimization that might
be useful is a good justification.
