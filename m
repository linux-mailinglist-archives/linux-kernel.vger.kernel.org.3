Of course it was decided by kernel developers. Point is that they use
the EFI standard as argument for bypassing the API. What I am saying is
that others can (and likely will, since the flood doors have been opened)
do the same in the future, using the same line of arguments.

Correct.

Ah, yes, you are right. The emmc example does reset the emmc, after all,
which one could use as argument that it "violates" the EFI mandate.
Sorry, I guess you'll be stuck with out-of-tree code (and, realistically,
so is everyone using emmc in an arm64 based system with an EFI restart
handler which does not implement emmc reset). Actually, turns out that
the emmc restart handling code is not reliable anyway, since for example
x86 doesn't use/support the restart handler call chain, and neither
do several other architectures.

Interestingly, in this context, x86 isn't as inflexible as arm64 and does
support other means to reset the system even in the presence of EFI
(and actually seems to prefer ACPI reset over EFI reset unless I
misunderstand the code).

Other options for you might be to disable EFI restart handling in your
system (assuming that is possible), or to implement the necessary code
as part of the EFI restart handler, ie outside Linux, again if that is
possible.
