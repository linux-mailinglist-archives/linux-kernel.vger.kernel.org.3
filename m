Already been there and no it is not as straight forward as one may 
think. A minimal driver was attempted but rejected by the TPM 
maintainers with the requirement to reuse the existing driver code. So 
we would gladly welcome someone to come rewrite the TPM drive. 
Specifically to de-tangle the core TPM interface code away from all of 
its kernel proper dependencies so that it can be used by both the setup 
kernel and the kernel proper.

With all due respect, the statement above demonstrates a clear lack of 
understanding how the hardware dynamic launch works. I have written a 
summary[1], with links to details, of how the process works. It is 
highly recommended this is read, as well as the referenced sections in 
Intel's SDM and AMD's APM.

The hook approach does all of this.

I completely agree and my intent is to get there eventually.

That is not what is being proposed.

Nothing in this proposal binds it to the Linux Boot Protocol.
