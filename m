Currently the 'interrupts' and 'interrupt-names' are defined being too
generic to really describe any actual IRQ interface. Moreover the DW PCIe
End-point devices are left with no IRQ signals. All of that can be fixed
by adding the IRQ-related properties to the common DW PCIe DT-schema and
defining a common and device-specific set of the IRQ names in accordance
with the hardware reference manual. Seeing there are common and dedicated
IRQ signals for DW PCIe Root Port and End-point controllers we suggest to
split the IRQ names up into two sets: common definitions available in the
snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml schema and Root Port specific names defined in
the snps,dw-pcie.yaml schema. The former one will be applied to both DW
PCIe RP and EP controllers, while the later one - for the RP only.

Note since there are DW PCI-based vendor-specific DT-bindings with the
custom names assigned to the same IRQ resources we have no much choice but
to add them to the generic DT-schemas in order to have the schemas being
applicable for such devices. Let's mark these names as deprecated so not
to encourage the new DT-bindings to use them.

Changelog v3:
- This is a new patch unpinned from the next one:
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220503214638.1895-2-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
  by the Rob' request. (@Rob)

Changelog v5:
- Add platform-specific interrupt names, but mark them as deprecated.
