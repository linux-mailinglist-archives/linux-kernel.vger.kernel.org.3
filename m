The idea of the UEFI specification is that it is OS agnostic. So 
anything that is Linux-, Windows-, BSD-, etc. specific should not live 
in the UEFI firmware.

If you want to implement any Linux specific extra protocol, you should 
implement it in Shim, GRUB, the kernel stub or any other UEFI binary 
loaded by the UEFI firmware but, please, don't rely on the UEFI firmware 
itself to implement it.

If you are able to abstract the requirements for furthering secure boot 
in a way that is OS agnostic, then implementation in the UEFI firmware 
starts to make sense. But remember that there is a large installed base 
that is still lagging behind the current UEFI standard.
