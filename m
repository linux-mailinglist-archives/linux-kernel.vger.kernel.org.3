I'm not a fan of that original proposal of mine anymore (to be more
precise, of _only_ that patch, there's still the RFCness reason 1) to
consider).
As I shared with the last reply there, there's a problem in the behavior
which shouldn't be masked by filtering some events.

I still think that the behavior when there's no protection left for the
memory.low == 0 child, there should be no memory.low events (not just
uncounted but not happening) and test should not accept this (even
though it's the current behavior).

What might improve the test space would be to have two configs like

Original one (simplified here)
	parent		memory.low=50M	memory.current=100M
	` child1	memory.low=50M	memory.current=50M
	` child2	memory.low=0M	memory.current=50M

New one (checks events due to recursive protection)
	parent		memory.low=50M	memory.current=100M
	` child1	memory.low=40M	memory.current=50M
	` child2	memory.low=0M	memory.current=50M

The second config assigns recursive protection to child2 and should
therefore cause memory.low events in child2 (with memory_recursiveprot
enabled of course).

Or alternative new one (checks events due to recursive protection)
	parent		memory.low=50M	memory.current=100M
	` child1	memory.low=0M	memory.current=50M
	` child2	memory.low=0M	memory.current=50M

HTH,
Michal
