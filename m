Ok, good to hear that you have already thought about that.

Files in general but I was specifically referring to securityfs here as
that's the relevant bit here.

Yeah, right now they don't really explain the how and why. What I'm
saying is that the commit messages - at least for the namespace part and
the securityfs part - aren't detailed enough.

When Mimi ends up sending the PR for this she can then put links to all
previous versions in the pull request mail or in the tag. I'm only
suggesting you do it that way. Since this will be Mimi's PR it'll be her
decision.
So for now it would just be nice to put links to previous versions at
the end of your cover letter. Because if you rework the series as I
suggested you won't have a 1:1 correspondence between patches anymore as
you did vor v1 to v7.
