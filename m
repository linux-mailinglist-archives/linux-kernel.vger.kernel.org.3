Support for including fs-verity file digests and signatures in the IMA
measurement list as well as verifying the fs-verity file digest based
signatures, all based on IMA policy rules, was discussed from the
beginning, prior to fs-verity being upstreamed[1,2].

Support including fs-verity file digests in the 'd-ng' template field
based on a new policy rule option named 'digest_type=hash|verity'.
Also support verifying fs-verity file digest based signatures based on
policy.

A new template field named 'd-type' as well as a new template named
'ima-ngv2' are defined to differentiate betweeen file hashes and fs-verity
file digests, when file signatures are not included in the IMA measurement
list.

To disambiguate the type of file signature, define IMA_VERITY_SIG xattr
type and a new signature format version, which is a hash of the new
ima_file_id structure.

Changelog v3:
- Addressed Eric Bigger's comments: included Ack, incremented the
  signature format version, the crypto issues are generic and will be
  addressed by him separately.
- Addressed Vitaly Chikunov's comments: hard coded maximum digest size
  rather than using a flexible array, removed unnecessary assignment, and
  fixed comment to match variable name.
- Defined new "ima_max_digest_size" struct to avoid wrapping the
  "ima_digest_data" struct inside a function local structure or
  having to dynamically allocate it with enough memory for the specific
  hash algo size.

Changelog v2:
- Addressed Eric Bigger's comments: sign the hash of fsverity's digest
  and the digest's metadata, use match_string, use preferred function
  name fsverity_get_digest(), support including unsigned fs-verity's
  digests in the IMA measurement list.
- Remove signatures requirement for including fs-verity's file digests in
  the 'd-ng' field of the measurement list.

Changelog v1:
- Updated both fsverity and IMA documentation.
- Addressed both Eric Bigger's and Lakshmi's comments.

Mimi Zohar (8):
  ima: rename IMA_ACTION_FLAGS to IMA_NONACTION_FLAGS
  ima: define ima_max_digest_data struct without a flexible array
    variable
  fs-verity: define a function to return the integrity protected file
    digest
  ima: define a new template field 'd-type' and a new template
    'ima-ngv2'
  ima: include fsverity's file digests in the IMA measurement list
  ima: define signature version 3
  ima: support fs-verity file digest based version 3 signatures
  fsverity: update the documentation
