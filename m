It would be nice to somehow summarize what I wrote. I mean to explain
why the problem is easier to see with revert and not with forward
transition.

It is because TIF_PATCH_FLAG might stay cleared in the child even
when it was set again in the parent by the klp_revert_transtion().
As a result, the child will never get transition back to the reverted
state.

The problem is hard to hit during the forward transition because
child might have TIF_PATCH_FLAG still set even when
it might later copy an already migrated task->patch_state
when parent gets migrated in the race window. In this case,
the TIF_PATCH_FLAG will get cleared when the child returns
from fork and all will be good.

In each case, the inconsistent state is there even during
the forward transition. But it would be caught only when
the entire transition is finished during the rather small
race window.

The patch should fix the race in any direction.

I could provide even better description after I am back
from vacation on Aug 22.

Best Regards,
Petr
