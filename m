Hello Bjorn,

Cyril sent me an email about a week ago saying that he probably
wouldn't have the bandwidth to test this.
I immediately ordered an overpriced CM4 via Ebay and it recently
arrived.  I'm happy to say that this
patchset tests successfully, w/ or w/o a device in the slot.

That being said, there is an old device, when paired with the CM4,
works with RPi Linux but not with upstream Linux.  It is unrelated
to this patchset; i.e. it fails w/ or w/o this patchset applied.  I
know the reason for this failure: the current driver
assumes clkreq# asserted, which is true for all STB boards.  I can add
a patch for this now or in the next release
cycle, your choice.

Regards,
Jim Quinlan
