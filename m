We now have tested the patch on major platforms, and it works without 
any
issues. But in case of firmware bugs I have changed the code to only
modify attributes if either EFI_MEMORY_RO or EFI_MEMORY_WP is set and
the memory has type EfiGcdMemoryTypeSystemMemory.

I also added option CONFIG_EFI_DXE_MEM_ATTRIBUTES (enabled by default),
to allow this code to be disabled at compile time.

These changes will be sent in version 3 of the patch.

Thanks,
Baskov Evgeniy
