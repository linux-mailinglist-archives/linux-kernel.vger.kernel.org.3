What is the locking issue there exactly?

I'm looking at ima_fs_ns_late_init() and there's nothing there that
would cause obvious issues. You might not be able to use
securityfs_create_*() in there for some reason but that just means you
need to add a simple helper. Nearly every filesystem that needs to
pre-create files does it in fill_super. So I really fail to see what the
issue is currently. I mist just miss something obvious.
