 Yeah, I guess if anything, it *had* to be IA64!

 Conversely Alpha systems decode the full 32-bit address range for port 
I/O and happily assign I/O bars beyond 64K in their firmware, however as 
a uniform address space even across several peer PCI buses.

 As to x86 systems as I mentioned they have native port I/O access machine
instructions and they only support 16-bit addressing, so I wouldn't expect 
more than one 64K of port I/O space implemented with them.  There is no 
problem at the CPU bus level of course with presenting port I/O addresses 
beyond 64K and as a matter of interest the original 80386 CPU did make use 
of them internally for communicating with the 80387 FPU, just because they 
cannot be produced with machine code and therefore a programmer could not 
interfere with the CPU-to-FPU communication protocol.  Port I/O locations
0x800000f8 through 0x800000ff were actually used in that protocol[1][2].

 Unfortunately just as IRQ 0 is considered special and barring the 8254 
special exception for PC-style legacy junk it means "no IRQ", similarly 
I/O port or MMIO address 0 is considered "no device" in several places.  
One I have identified as noted above is `uart_configure_port':

	/*
	 * If there isn't a port here, don't do anything further.
	 */
	if (!port->iobase && !port->mapbase && !port->membase)
		return;

So even if we let address 0 through it will be rejected downstream here 
and there and the device won't work.

 I can sympathise with that.

 I have discovered it with an 8250-compatible UART option card and when I 
patched up `pci_iomap_range' to let address 0 through, I have learnt the 
hard way it is not going to work, as described above.  And I think the 
special semantics of bus address 0 has been there with us since forever, 
so I dare not change it as people surely have relied on it.

 I could see if the parport_pc driver for the parallel port option card I
now have installed instead would be happy with one of its decode ranges 
set to 0, but I'm not sure if there's any value in such a check given my 
observation.

 We're still doing better with my proposal than systems that have a legacy 
southbridge do, as we're only losing one increment of the BAR decode range 
rather than 4K of the I/O port address space that those systems do.
