Greetings,

My name is (Dr Alima Kamara) I am working with one of the prime banks
here in Burkina Faso. Here in this bank existed a dormant account for
many years, which belong to one of our late foreign customer Mr.
Moises Saba Masri from Mexico.

You can get more information's as regards to this on below
website:http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3832556,00.html

When I discovered that there had been neither deposits nor withdrawals
from this account for this long period, I decided to carry out a
system investigation and discovered that none of the family member or
relations of the late person are aware of this account, which means
nobody will come to take it.

The amount in this account stands at $18,300, 000.00 (Eighteen Million
Three Hundred Thousand USA Dollars). I want a foreign account where
the bank will transfer this fund, I will front you in the bank as the
Next of Kin to the late customer and back you up with relevant
information.

What the bank need is proof and information about the late customer
which I will assist you on. this is a genuine, risk free and legal
business transaction, All details shall be sent to you once I hear
from you.

The information as contained herein be accorded the necessary
attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.

If you are really sure of your integrity, trustworthy and
confidentiality reply back to me urgently through my private email
here: ( kamaraalima287@gmail.com   ).

Best regards,
Dr Alima Kamara.
