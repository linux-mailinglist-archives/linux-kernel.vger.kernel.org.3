I don't see how that can work: __finalise_sg() does more than convert
them from relative to absolute, it also figures out which SG entry will
contain which dma_address segment. Which segment a P2PDMA address needs
to be programmed into depends on the how 'cur' is calculated which in
turn depends on things like seg_mask and max_len. This calculation is
not done in iommu_dma_map_sg() so I don't see how there's any hope of
assigning the bus address for the P2P segments in that function.

If there's a way to restructure things so that's possible that I'm not
seeing, I'm open to it but it's certainly not immediately obvious.

Oh, that's pretty simple to add. Will change.

Yeah, looking at it closer, I can't see how to get rid of the zero size
special case without doing the whole pci_p2pdma_map_type() calculation
twice which we really want to avoid.
