Are you trying to make your card work on any ACPI based system (x86,
x86-64, etc)?  Or do you have a specific model of computer that you
want to make this work on for a specific customer or appliance?

If for many arbitrary systems, can you limit it to one architecture
or sub-architecture?

Yes.  I was envisioning the pre-bootloader, bootloader, or Linux pre-boot
shim dynamically determining the slot containing the card, and applying
the overlay devicetree to the base devicetree, retargeting the overlay
to the proper location, before the Linux boot.

The base devicetree would be for a specific type of machine or family
of machines, just as is the case for all devicetree based systems.

Your welcome.  I'll keep looking deeper into the previous threads.
