You're talking about IMS not MSI-X here, right? IMS cannot be allocated
via the PCI/MSI interfaces as we established long ago.

And if you are talking about the 8 MSI-X interrupts for IDXD then I
really do not see the point of ever releasing it.

For MSI-X the free vector use case does not exist today and even if it
would exist the driver has to know about the index.

If the index -> function accociation is hard wired, it needs to know it
obviously.

If it's not hardwired then it still needs to know the resulting index,
because it has to program that index into a device function register so
that the device knows which entry to use.

IMS is not any different. You need to know the index in order to
associate it to the queue, no? And you need the index in order to figure
out the Linux irq number.

But again, that's not a problem of this very API because this API is
about PCI/MSI and not about IMS.

That can work, but then we need both variants:

     pci_msix_alloc_vector_at() and pci_msix_alloc_vector_any()

Why?

Because pci_msix_alloc_vector_any() cannot solve the VFIO on demand
allocation problem and it cannot be used to replace the sparse
allocations which are done via pci_enable_msix_exact() today.

If there is an MSI-X use case to allocate any vector then we can
implement that. If there is none, then we don't need it, right?

Was it really necessary to bring those memories back?

If we want groups, then surely not with these kind of hacks. I still
need to see the usecase for the groups. The discussion back then just
provided handwaving about internal request which never materialized.

But talking about groups. That's very similar to the other discussion
vs. storing the IMS entries for these sliced devices, queues or
whatever. That's at least a use case.

VFIO exactly knows which entry is unmasked simply because the write into
the MSI-X table in the device config space is trapped so it knows
exactly which entry is unmasked, no? Guess how VFIO knows about $N more?

We are not implementing the full MSI[X] zoo for IMS either. So the
interfaces are different in the first place.

Making them artificially uniform is a horrible idea.

They are two different things, really. The only thing they have in common
is that at the end of the day the device sends a message over the bus
and they happen to share the underlying MSI code infrastructure.
