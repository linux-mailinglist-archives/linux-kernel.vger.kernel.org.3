I think so.  I don't *like* papering over it, but the quirk only
compensates for one situation (pci_save_ltr_state() and
pci_restore_ltr_state()).  Any other places where we might read/write
the LTR values will still fail.  We don't have any other places yet,
but if/when we get ASPM L1.2 figured out, I think we will.

If we had a quirk mechanism for filtering config accesses to certain
devices, that would be ideal, but I don't think we have that.  If you
squint hard enough, aer_inject.c has something like that, but it's not
general purpose.

Maybe also in pcie_aspm_cap_init() for the L1 PM part.  Just a
one-liner should be enough.  All the details will be in the commit log
and the app note.
