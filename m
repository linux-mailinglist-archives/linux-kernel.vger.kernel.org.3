That could be an issue.

What do you mean by nothing effectively changes?

Since the check is done on a taskset level, if only one of the tasks in 
the taskset fails, the whole taskset fails. Maybe we should consider an 
option for task based migration. So all the tasks that can be migrated 
will be migrated and the rests will be left behind in the original 
cpuset. Just a thought.
