Yes, that is the API to designed to be used if overlays are applied
after the kernel has booted.

That was my understanding too.

I would not object to doing that.  But I suspect there are other people
who might.  I much prefer that overlays be applied before boot.

Yes, generic use leads to a lot of the complications of implementing
runtime overlays.

This example might be the best example of such a use case.  As it is
claimed that the drivers for the devices on the board do not access
anything on the host other than the pcie slot.

That is the motivation behind my questions of how generic or targeted
the use of this one specific card is.

A pre-boot shim that discovers the card and applies the overlay could
be somewhat generic to ACPI systems.

Is the overlay approach also being proposed for DT based systems?

I thought the intent was to use DT API drivers, not fwnode API drivers.
And I thought the card was not to be described by ACPI, so there would
not be any ACPI fwnode info for the card _and_ fwnode is somewhat
irrelevant since the drivers are using the DT API.  So the enforcement
you mention could be implemented by the overlay apply code verifying
that there is no ACPI fwnode for any DT node in the overlay.  So not
an _assumption_, but a testable rule.

That is a long way of essentially agreeing with you.

Is that the XRT Alveo driver infrastructure thread?  I was not cc:ed
on that thread, and just recently stumbled upon it.  Yet another
thread that is on my to-read list.
