cgroup_rstat_updated() should only take the percpu cgroup_rstat_cpu_lock 
the first time it transition from "!updated" to "updated". After that, 
it returns immediately without the the lock. With a regular list, you 
will have to take the lock every time a new block device has an update. 
So there isn't much saving on the update side. In general, the 
lock/unlock sequence has a bit more overhead than the lockless 
insertion. On the flush side, there may be a bit of saving, but it is 
not the fast path.
