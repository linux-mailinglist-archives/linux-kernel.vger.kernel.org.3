For patch #3 I needed to allocate a separate request queue as the scsi 
device is not created by that stage.

And then for other scenarios in which we allocate the separate request 
queue, since the scheme here is to allocate a request queue with 
different ops, we can't use the same scsi_device request queue.

note: As for allocating request queues for the lifetime of the host, we 
need to remember that blk-mq fairly reserves a tag budget per request 
queue, and it would be a waste to keep a budget just for these internal 
commands. So that is why I only keep the request queues temporarily.

That sounds reasonable.

For this series I am just fixing up libsas, and libsas has a sas_task 
per command already, so we can just allocate the sas_task separately and 
use the host_scribble to point to the sas_task.

Other drivers can do something similar to above or use the scsi priv data.

I see. So you want to allocate a request, mark as "internal", and then 
we have a flag which can be used to decide which path we need to send it 
on. eh, maybe scsi_cmnd.submitter could be used
