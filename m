Well, it's a no-op except for the fact that we should continue on to
add a save buffer and clear the AER status, so if we applied this
patch, I think an alloc failure (unlikely though it is) would mean we
would continue using the device, but the AER init for it wouldn't be
done correctly.

I think we need to drop this patch, and if there is a null pointer
dereference elsewhere, fix that.
