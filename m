That is the wrong direction IMO. The idea is that well behaved cases 
just use the generic code and avoid any driver specific code. The DWC 
common code is not generic code. It's also keeping with the "don't 
create mid layers" philosophy.

We have generic 32-bit only accessors too (even though that's broken 
h/w, it's broken so often we needed generic accessors), so if that's 
your restriction, then use those. That way, it is very clear which 
drivers (all of them, not just DWC) use generic accessors, have 
alignment restrictions, or something completely custom.

Those drivers are special. They get to keep their special code.
