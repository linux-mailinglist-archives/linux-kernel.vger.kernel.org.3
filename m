Ok. I had just used the same types as there were previously. The types are 
a big mess, int and size_t conversions being done back and forth within 
that callchain for count. And now that you mentioned unsigned it 
seems that fp (flag ptr) is also inconsistent.

You mean that the flag ptr is now unsigned char * (which I didn't even 
touch)?

Your comment leaves me to wonder though, what you now want for the 
lookahead count (the last arg), size_t or unsigned int? Lookahead count 
cannot be negative, and AFAICT, count neither because that would mean tty 
has to return some characters back :-).

...Maybe I'll do another patch post these fix ones to match/correct the 
types.
