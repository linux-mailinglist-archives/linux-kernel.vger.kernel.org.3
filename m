What API are folks supposed to use exactly? That's the only API to
apply an overlay. I thought the FPGA mgr code was using it too, but
it's not. It doesn't look to me like the upstream code there even
works as nothing applies the overlays AFAICT. If there are no in
kernel users applying overlays, then let's remove the overlay code. I
hear it has lots of problems.

I am *way* more comfortable with driver specific applying of overlays
than any generic mechanism. I don't think we'll ever have a generic
mechanism. At least not one that doesn't end up with the same usage
constraints driver specific cases would have.

The exception being specific drivers that are only applying overlays
isolated to their device as this usecase is. The usecase here is
entirely self-contained. The only base tree is only what's needed to
represent the PCI device.

Adding a layer, the solution to all problems...

I don't think that's a workable solution unless all the components are
in one party's control. Given the desire to work on ACPI and DT based
systems, that doesn't sound like the case here.

The idea here is what is described by ACPI and DT are disjoint which I
think we can enforce. Enforcement comes from fwnode assuming it has
either an ACPI or a DT handle, but not both.

There is also the Xilinx folks wanting to support their PCI FPGA card
with DT for the FPGA contents on both ACPI and DT systems.
