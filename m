It seems like it might be helpful to split the async shutdowns into 
refcounted hierarchies and proceed with the next level up when all the 
refs are in.

Ex:
00:00.0 - RP
   01:00.0 - NVMe A
   02:00.0 - Bridge USP
     03:00.0 - Bridge DSP
       04:00.0 - NVMe B
     03:00.1 - Bridge DSP
       05:00.0 - NVMe C

NVMe A could start shutting down at the beginning of the hierarchy 
traversal. Then async shutdown of bus 3 wouldn't start until all 
children of bus 3 are shutdown.

You could probably do this by having the async_shutdown_list in the pci_bus.
