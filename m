Indeed you did! Many thanks!

It is just that patch 11 that defines "select HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE" did not receive any comments from you (unless I missed a comment that came from you. That is entirely possible. If I missed it, my bad). Since you suggested that change, I just wanted to make sure that that patch looks OK to you.
