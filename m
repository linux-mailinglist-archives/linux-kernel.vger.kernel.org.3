Sorry, I was expecting a new version with some of my comments
addressed, in case that had effects on subsequent patches.

I would very much like to upstream the ones I have given a Reviewed-by.

Given those were conditional on some adjustments (e.g. actually filling
out comments), do you mind if I pick those into a series now?

Then, once that's picked, you can rebase the rest atop, and we can
review that.

Thanks,
Mark.
