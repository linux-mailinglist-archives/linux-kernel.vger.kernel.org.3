1) All the copy/paste is ugly and IMO guaranteed to eventually introduce
   bugs when somebody forgets to update the copy.  Wouldn't it be more
   robust to reuse the existing apply_relocate_add() code by making it
   more generic somehow, like with a new 'clear' bool arg which sets
   'val' to zero?

2) We can't only fix x86, powerpc also needs a fix.

3) A selftest would be a good idea.
