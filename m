For an ASCII-art to be recognized as such, you need a leading "::" here.

This enumeration list needs some indent tweaks.

1. It introducing Port Gasket in PF0 which is responsible for FPGA management,
   like FME and Port management. The Port Gasket contains all the PR specific modules
   and logic, e.g., PR slot reset/freeze control, user clock, remote STP etc.
   Architecturally, a Port Gasket can have multiple PR slots where user workload can
   be programmed into.
2. To expend the scalable of FPGA, it can support multiple FPs in static region
   which contain some static functions like VirtIO, diagnostic test, and access over
   VFIO or assigned to VMs easily. Those PFs will not have a Port Unit which without
   PR region (AFU) connected to those PFs, and the end-user cannot partial reconfigurate
   those PFs.
3. In our previous DFL design, it can only create one VF based in an AFU. To raise
   the efficiency usage of AFU, it can create more than one VFs in an AFU via PCIe
   SRIOV, so those VFs share the PR region and resource.

As above, this list should look:

1. The Port Gasket connects to FIU Port in DFL, but the Next_AFU pointer in
   FIU feature header can point to NULL so that it is no AFU connects to a FIU
   Port.
2. The VF which include in PR region can start with AFU feature header without
   a FIU Port feature header.

I'd recommend running "make htmdocs" and see if the pages are rendered as you
expect.
