No doubt there is way to much variation here (ummm, Qcom!). Some 
standardization of names in (new) bindings would be good. That's where 
we should be defining names IMO.

On the driver side, I'd like to see the DW core handle clocks/resets/phys 
at least for the easy cases of just turn on/off all the clocks and 
toggle all resets. Perhaps even more minimally, move the clk/reset 
struct pointers to the DWC core.

IOW, I'm not sure this patch is really helpful without some of the above 
happening.
