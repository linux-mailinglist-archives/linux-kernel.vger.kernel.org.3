Sure, happens, but I don't remember the discussion, so replying that
late will not help your cause.

You know that if you (you as Samsung) worked with upstream, e.g. by
extending the drivers and keeping them in shape, it would be much easier
for you (again you as Samsung) to actually add new features? It's much
better/effective approach than the path of pushing every time new driver
with explanation like "we do not want to maintain older driver, so we
want a new one"...

It usually trivial to code such difference in the driver.

Indeed.

For the phy driver indeed it might require much effort to create one driver.

Maybe, quite probably. The reluctance to extend any existing code makes
me doubting this, but I admit that there are many differences.

At the end it's mostly the decision of PCIe and phy subsystem
maintainers whether they want to have separate drivers for DWC PCIe
blocks in ARMv8 Samsung SoCs.

In any case, the driver code looks like copied-pasted from some vendor
sources, so you need to bring it to shape.

Best regards,
