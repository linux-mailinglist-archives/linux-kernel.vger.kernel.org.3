Yes, looks like that zeros are in emulated config space for fields not
explicitly initialized. Which is the pci-mvebu.c case.

But now I'm looking at pci-aardvark.c driver and it sets
PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN register to A:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/pci/controller/pci-aardvark.c?h=v5.16-rc8#n953
And that comment "/* Support interrupt A for MSI feature */" must be
total nonsense as INTA for sure is not required for MSI... Plus we know
that pci-aardvark.c driver does not implement for pci bridge neither
INTx nor MSI... Ach... seems that this code is here since beginning and
needs to be fixed...
