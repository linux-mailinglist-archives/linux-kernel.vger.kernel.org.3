But they are named by IP version. It's just that people didn't add these
groups of callbacks in IP version order. (And the fact that different IP
version share some of these callbacks between revisions doesn't help.)

But sure, adding support for a new version would be easier if there's an
obvious sorting of the callbacks (as long as people notice the order).

Ok. Thanks.
