Yes, these are just two examples to give a more complete idea of the
semantics by specifying two cases and how ima would behave.

This is just an example what the current semantics mean in practice.
The above code snippet is neither good nor bad by itself as that depends
on context:

1) Let's say for whatever reason you would like to let unprivileged
   containers add policy rules (sorry in case I'm using the wrong ima
   vernacular) for themselves to the initial ima namespace during
   startup. That can be a rather valid and important use-case. Then this
   code snipped above where root opens a policy fd in the host
   securityfs instance and then let's the container access it across
   fork() + post namespace creation is "good" as it will allow the
   container to write the rules during setup while e.g. letting the
   container manager process (the code prior to fork) continue doing
   other stuff.

2) If you only want to ever allow container manager on the host write
   rules for the container in the initial ima ns but never the container
   setup process itself then the above code is "bad". The policy fd
   should've been closed before the fork() and definitely be opened
   o-cloexec.

The examples really were just trying to make obvious what the semantics
are that you're buying.
