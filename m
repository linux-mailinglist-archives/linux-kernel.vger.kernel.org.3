 I have a patch in the queue for $IRT table support too, according to your 
and some later findings about it.  Just waiting for an ack off-list from 
someone, so I'll hopefully post it sometime this week.  Sadly I've been 
quite loaded with higher-priority stuff recently meaning I can't dedicate 
so much time to these patches as I would like to.  We'll get there though 
sooner or later.

 Thanks for your confirmation as to the usability of these changes.
