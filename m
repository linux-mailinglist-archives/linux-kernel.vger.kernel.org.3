Got it. Thanks for clarification.

Ok, but we need to settle the suggested modification design before
the next patchset re-submission. The splitting up is a lot of additional work,
while I have already spent so much time on this and on the rest of the
DW PCIe-related patches.

When it comes to the generic and vendor-specific IP-core device
implementations the approach suggested by me is more flexible, but yet
restrictive enough to cover your case. It is suitable for all already
defined vendor-specific DT bindings, the generic DW PCIe-compatible
bindings, new DT bindings yet to come. Here are the cases it can be
used for:

1) DW PCIe platforms fully compatible with the generic IP-core
schema, but with already defined vendor-specific resource
names. Solution:
$ref: /schemas/pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml#
and define all the vendor-specific resource names. If the
reg/interrupt/clock/reset-names are partly compatible with the
generic schema, then they can be directly referenced from the
"definitions" property in the "oneOf" composition.

2) DW PCIe platforms partly compatible with the generic IP-core
DT schema. Solution:
$ref: /schemas/pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml#
and define all the vendor-specific resource names. Refer to the
generic "reg/interrupt/clock/reset"-names in the particular names
arrays aside with the platform-specific resource names (this especially
concerns the reg-names property, which aside with the standard CSRs
may have additional non-standard CSRs defined).

3) DW PCIe platforms fully compatible with the generic IP-core
DT schema. Solution:
$ref: /schemas/pci/snps,dw-pcie.yaml#
or
$ref: /schemas/pci/snps,dw-pcie-ep.yaml#
If there are resource names which are defined in the generic schema
and are applicable to the platform-specific device (like additional
required names) they can be added to the vendor DT-schema otherwise
the generic schema reference is enough (see the baikal,bt1-pcie.yaml
DT-schema being added in the framework of this patchset).

New DW PCIe platforms are encouraged to use schema 3). In case if
there are resources not specific to the generic DW PCIe IP-core,
they need to have the schema 2) utilized. Since we can't change the
already defined bindings, we have no choice but to use schema 1) for
them. Thus the suggested here schemas can be used to create more
descriptive and restrictive enough DT-schemas hierarchy covering all
the currently defined bindings and new ones.

In anyway regarding what you said in the message above adding new
generic names is possible only in case if they are applicable to the
generic DW PCIe IP-core (almost all of them I've already listed in the
snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml#definitions property) otherwise such names
need to be defined in the platform-specific schema.

Traditional generic schema design when all the generic properties are
directly listed in the generic DT-schema in the corresponding property
is too restrictive to implement the cases 1) and 2). Thus such generic
schema needs to be extended with the non-generic names (or not to have
the names listed in the generic schema at all). It implicitly
makes all the platforms permitting such resources, which isn't true.

Sadly, but you're right. In the framework of this patchset I suggest a
method to organize all old and new DT bindings (for DW PCIe devices)
in a way so them all be using the generic DW PCIe DT-schema at the
most applicable part. 

> The biggest validation gap I see is 
> we don't enforce the order and this patch does nothing to address that.

I happen to have the opposite opinion regarding the order of the
names listed in the *-names properties. Why do you need them to be
defined in a strict order? reg and reg-names are tightly coupled.
The DW PCIe driver refer to the CSRs and IRQs by their names. So the
order is irrelevant in this case. If the order is required, then it
can be constrained in the platform-specific schema.
