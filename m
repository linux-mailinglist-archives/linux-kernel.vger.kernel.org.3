Ah, great! One general comment, though - iommu-map/msi-map have pretty 
much grown into common IOMMU/MSI consumer properties by now, so IMO 
they'd be better off living alongside their respective iommus/msi-parent 
counterparts, so that other consumers like fsl-mc and host1x can 
reference a common definition rather than duplicating their own. The 
only aspect that should still belong to the PCI binding is the detail of 
how PCI B:D:F forms the input ID for the mappings (and equivalently for 
other bus bindings).

Thanks,
Robin.
