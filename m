There's long threads about it on the ksummit discuss mailing list and
other places.

Sorry, I didn't mean to imply the ordering of the devm code is
incorrect, that's fine.

It's when you have things in the devm "chain" that need to be freed in a
different order that stuff gets messy.  Like irqs and clocks and other
types of resources that have "actions" associated with them.

I have never used devm_add_action_or_reset() so I can't say why it is
there.  I am just pointing out that manually messing with a sysfs group
from a driver is a huge flag that something is wrong.  A driver should
almost never be touching a raw kobject or calling any sysfs_* call if
all is normal, which is why I questioned this.

Try it the way I suggest, with a remove() callback, and see if that
looks simpler and easier to follow and maintain over time.
