Thanks for collecting that data!

I don't think spurious hotplug before probing the hotplug service is
an issue because there is always a window like this.  It's either
between:

  A: Handoff from firmware to OS
  B: get_port_device_capability()

or between:

  A: Handoff from firmware to OS
  C: pciehp initialization

Either way there is *some* window, and we have to decide how to deal
with it.  The exact duration is not very important.
