The problem recurrence method is described below:
First, add the patch I changed. It then launches normally to the console 
command line.  Finally, run the stty command to change buad rate. The 
detailed commands are as follows:
stty -F /dev/ttyAML0 115200 and stty -F /dev/ttyAML0 921600 .Alternate 
execution can reproduce.

I only have S4 and G12A so far, so I've only tested on those two platforms.
