The problem I'm describing exists for all FPGA based PCI cards; so I am 
purposely trying to be abstract as much as possible.

Yes, old pci id's could be reused, and people have done just that.  We 
thought a new PCI ID would minimize confusion with cards that have already 
been deployed.

Subvendor and Subid are managed just like any other PCI card with or 
without a FPGA.

If a board doesn't have a max10, then there will be no DFH for a max10 in 
the board's DFLs.  Presumeably, the board would need some update process, 
and an approprate DFH would be in that board's DFL.
