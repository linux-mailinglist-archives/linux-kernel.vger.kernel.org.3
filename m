Some time ago Muchun posted patches based on the reusing of the obj_cgroup API.

I'm not strictly against this approach, but in my opinion it's not the best.
I suggested to use lru vectors as an intermediate objects. In theory, it might
allow to avoid bumping reference counters for all charged pages at all: live
cgroups will be protected by being live, dying cgroups will only need
a temporarily protection while lru vectors and associated pages are reparenting.

There are pros and cons:
+ cgroup reference counting becomes simpler and more debuggable
+ potential perf wins from fewer operations with live cgroups css refcounters
= I hope to see code simplifications (but not guaranteed)
- deleting cgroups becomes more expensive, but the cost can be spread to
  asynchronous workers

Idk if Muchun tried to implement it. If not, I might try myself.

Thanks!
