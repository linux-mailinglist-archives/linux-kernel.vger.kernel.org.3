Thanks for the explanation. It's worth putting some of this in the changelog in
the next versions.

So the problem is as I suspected, but capacity inversion is the major cause of
grief.

Is it okay to share what the capacities of the littles, mediums and bigs on
your system? And how they change under worst case scenario thermal pressure?
Only IF you have these numbers handy :-)

Is it actually an indication of a potential other problem if you swing into
capacity inversion in the bigs that often? I've seen a lot of systems where the
difference between the meds and bigs is small. But frequent inversion could be
suspicious still.

Do the littles and the mediums experience any significant thermal pressure too?

It doesn't seem it'll cause a significant error, but still it seems to me this
function wants the original capacity passed to it.

There are similar questions to be asked since you modify sg_cpu->max. Every
user needs to be audited if they're fine with this change or not.

I'm not sure still what we are achieving here. You want to force schedutil not
to request higher frequencies if thermal pressure is high? Should schedutil
actually care? Shouldn't the cpufreq driver reject this request and pick the
next best thing if it can't satisfy it? I could be missing something, I haven't
looked that hard tbh :-)

It depends on the severity of the problem. The simplest thing I can suggest is
to check if the cpu is in capacity inversion state, and if it is, then make
rt_task_fits_capacity() return false always.

If we need a generic solution to handle thermal pressure omitting OPPs, then
the search needs to become more complex. The proposal in this patch is not
adequate because tasks that want to run at capacity_orig_of(cpu) will wrongly
omit some cpus because of any tiny thermal pressure. For example if the
capacity_orig_of(medium_cpu) = 700, and uclamp_min for RT is set to 700, then
any small thermal pressure on mediums will cause these tasks to run on big cpus
only, which is not what we want. Especially if these big cpus can end up in
capacity inversion later ;-)

So if we want to handle this case, then we need to ensure the search returns
false only if

	1. Thermal pressure results in real OPP to be omitted.
	2. Another CPU that can provide this performance level is available.

Otherwise we should still fit it on this CPU because it'll give us the closest
thing to what was requested.

I can think of 2 ways to implement this, but none of them seem particularly
pretty :-/
