I agree there's a defect in these SB600 devices.  My guess is that
PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE actually disables both INTx and MSI, when
it's only supposed to disable INTx.

I'm pretty sure the spec doesn't actually require software to set
Interrupt Disable when enabling MSI, since MSI was added in PCI r2.2,
which included this text in sec 6.8.2:

  System configuration software sets [the MSI Enable] bit to enable
  MSI. ...  Once enabled, a function is prohibited from using its
  INTx# pin (if implemented) to request service (MSI and INTx# are
  mutually exclusive).

and Interrupt Disable was added later, in PCI r2.3, with no mention of
a connection with MSI.  All the specs from PCI r2.2 to PCIe r6.0
include the text above about not using INTx# if MSI or MSI-X is
enabled, but that's not the same as requiring software to set
Interrupt Disable.  Linux has set Interrupt Disable when enabling MSI
ever since MSI support was added [1], so I would hesitate to change
that even though I don't think it's required.

What I don't like about PCI_DEV_FLAGS_MSI_INTX_DISABLE_BUG is that it
changes the generic code path in a sort of random way, i.e., this
device becomes yet another special case in how we handle Interrupt
Disable.

What would you think about just setting pdev->no_msi instead, so we
don't try to use MSI at all on these devices?  I think that's what we
did before 306c54d0edb6.
