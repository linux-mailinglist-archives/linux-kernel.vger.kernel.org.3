Abuse isn't just about using an API for something it isn't originally intended
for, abuse is also to intentionally _not_ use an API, as it is currently done
by the EFI restart code for arm64. Also, keep in mind that the same argument
(our restart handler _must_ be executed under all circumstances and does therefore
not use the restart API) is likely going to be used again in the future. All
it takes is for some other standard (or chip vendor, for that matter) to declare
their restart handler mandatory if present. That means there will be other
non-users of the restart API in the future, and you simply can not rely on it
being used. That was clearly not the intention of the restart API - quite the
opposite - but it is what it is.

Given that, I'd suggest to cut your losses and try to find another solution
for your problem. That may be to introduce yet another API, one that is called
before the EFI restart handling but that is always called, unlike reboot
notifiers, or simply stick with out-of-tree code.
