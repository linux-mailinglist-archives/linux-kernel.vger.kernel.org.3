[adding Michal to the recipients]

Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker. Top-posting for once,
to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Intel network maintainers, help me out here please. Has anything been
done to address this regression? It looks like Jaroslav didn't even get
a single reply. What's up there?

BTW, took a quick look into the issue and noticed a the patch "ice: Fix
promiscuous mode not turning off" from Michal:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220704131227.2966160-3-michal.wilczynski@intel.com/

Is this maybe fixing this? Then it would be good to add Link and
Reported-by tags to that patch.

Or is this something else and Jaroslav needs to bisect?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
