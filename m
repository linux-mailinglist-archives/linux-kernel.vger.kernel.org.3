Hi Eric

I thought that the solution I came with could satisfy multiple needs.

For people that don't want to use IMA, they could still continue
to use the existing signature format, and wait for an LSM that
satisfy their needs. They also have the option to migrate to the
new signature format you are defining. But will those people be
willing to switch to something IMA-specific?

For people that use IMA, they could benefit from the effort
of people creating packages with the original fsverity signature.

For people that are skeptical about IMA, they could be interested
in trying the full solution, which would probably be more easily
available if the efforts from both sides converge.

If, as you say, you have concerns about the existing signature
format, wouldn't it be better that you address them from the
fsverity side, so that all users of fsverity can benefit from it?

Currently, fsverity hashes the formatted digest whose format
is FSVerity<digest algo><digest size><digest>. Couldn't IMA
hash the same data as well?

An idea could be to always sign the formatted digest, and have
a selector for the signature format: IMA, PKCS#7 or PGP.

Thanks
