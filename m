Yes; that was the point I was making: *in this case* it doesn't matter at all,
and therefore *in this case* the existing code is fine.

It sounds like two things are being conflated here:

1) A *notification* that a restart will subsequently occur.
2) A *request* to initiate a restart.

IIUC (1) is supposed to be handled by the existing reboot notifier mechanism
(see the reboot_notifier_list) which *is* invoked prior to the EFI reboot
today.

IMO, using restart handlers as notifiers is an abuse of the interface, and
that's the fundamental problem.

What am I missing?

As above, IIUC those notification cases are supposed to be handled with reboot
notifiers, which are already supported in generic code across all
architectures, and should run before the EFI restart.

If there's a case where they're not, that's either an oversight or an edge case
that needs more consideration.

As above, I think that's just using the wrong interface, and the reboot
notifier mechanism *already* exists, so I'm really confused here.

Have I misunderstood what you're trying to achieve?

Is there some problem with the reboot notifier mechanism that I am unaware of?
e.g. do we bypass them in some case where you think they're needed?

Are you simply unaware of reboot notifiers?

Thanks,
Mark.
