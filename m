Ok. Do we need something more to sign other than the fsverity
formatted digest? If not, this could be the same for any method
we support.

If what we sign remains the same, then we could support multiple
methods and use a selector to let fsverity_verify_signature() know
how it should verify the signature. I don't know what would be a
proper place for the selector.

PKCS#7 seems ok, as it is used for kernel modules. IMA would be
also ok, as it can verify the signature more directly. I would also
be interested in supporting PGP, to avoid the requirement for
Linux distributions to manage a secondary key. I have a small
extension for rpmsign, that I would like to test in the Fedora
infrastructure.

Both the PKCS#7 and the PGP methods don't require additional
support from outside, the functions verify_pkcs7_signature()
and verify_pgp_signature() (proposed, not yet in the upstream
kernel) would be sufficient.

The IMA method instead would require the signature_v2_hdr
structure to be exported to user space, so that rpm could
produce a blob that can be interpreted by the kernel (this
work could also be done by evmctl). Also, IMA should pass
its .ima keyring to fsverity for signature verification, or should
simply get the signature and do the verification internally.

Given that fsverity has already the capability of managing the
signature blob, it would make sense to still keep it. Adding it
in an xattr could be possible, but it would introduce more
constraints (requiring the filesystem to support xattrs). And,
an user of fsverity willing to use the IMA method would have
to look at security.ima.

To summarize: I would prefer a method that relies on an
existing signature verification mechanism (PKCS#7) or that
has an equivalent API and simplify support for Linux distributions
(PGP). If we add the IMA method, available outside IMA, we
need to also add support for user space so that it can produces
the signature in the desired format, and preferably should use
the fsverity way of getting the signature. If the IMA method
would be used by IMA only, then IMA could store the signature
in its xattr and do the verification independently.
