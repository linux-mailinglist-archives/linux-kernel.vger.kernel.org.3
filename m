Fixes need testing. I don't want to merge fixes that break platforms
on which you can't test.

Also, fixes need bug reports and as far as I can see I have not
seen any reported that point at current mainline failures.

See above. We should not have fixes and cleanups in the
same series and I am not taking fixes that can affect other
platforms unless they are tested.

Feel free to ignore what I say, my comments still stand.

Sure. To merge fixes they need to be tested on platforms before
we can accept them and we need bug reports to show they are fixing
something in the first place.

See above.

We(I) don't have DWC HW and DWC maintainers are supposed to review DWC
code. We maintain the generic bits in host controller drivers to
make sure they guarantee a uniform behaviour across hosts.

That's what I have to say. If you want your code merged we need
to find a way to get DWC maintainers to test it and provide
review, I agree with you that feedback is lacking and that's
something that has to be solved.

Thanks for your patience.
