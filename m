Yes makes sense, in my current local version I've kept the direct
return here. I think I've also found a way to keep this even for the
isolated PCI function case. See below.

Ok. I would argue that the "fn =3D=3D 0 && !dev" is just the moved "!dev"
check for the initial pci_scan_single_device() that previously happened
outside the loop. With the modulo gone I can't think of any other way
to get fn =3D=3D 0 but in the first iteration.=20

But you are right, the extra test introduces some extra churn in
next_fn(). I think we can get rid of that new condition such that
next_fn() is more easily verifiable. See below.

I agree and I think we can get this with the transformed cases too.

To me the 0 return is part of the weirdness as it is a valid fn value,
so returning it from next_fn() would naturally communicate that the
next fn is fn 0 not that there are no more functions.

It feels like making next_fn() more obvious is worth the larger patch.
I think us having to convince ourselves of these details is testament
that it currently is very hard to understand the interactions here
while the new conditions for stopping the scan are each almost obvious.
So I think if we can convince ourselves that the new code is exactly
equivalent which I believe it is when keeping the check in the ARI
path, then that is what makes the patch save.

Ooh, just realized that my series changes the behavior for jailhouse
when the passed through device is not multifunction. In the existing
code pci_scan_single_device() is called for all devfn irrespective of
whether the first function found has dev->multifunction set after
scanning it. I'm not sure if that would happen if e.g. we have multiple
SR-IOV VFs but not the PF.

The extra mf parameter feels a bit superflous as we already have dev-
>multifunction and then would just move the "dev && (!)dev-
>multifunction" test out of next_fn().=20

To me this doesn't look like less of a change to next_fn() either. That
said, it gave me an idea. One way to change next_fn() less is to keep
the "fn =3D=3D 0 && !dev" test out of it and in pci_scan_slot(). That way
there are no new conditions in next_fn() and the existing conditions
can be transformed as proposed without mixing in new stuff.

With that the scan loop would look something like:

  int pci_scan_slot(...)
  {
    int fn =3D 0, nr =3D0 ;

    do {
      dev =3D pci_scan_single_device(bus, devfn + fn);
      if (dev) {
         ...
      } else if (fn =3D=3D 0) {
        /* missing function 0*/
        break;
      }
      fn =3D next_fn(bus, dev, fn);
    } while (fn);
  }

Even better this allows us to keep the "!dev" check in the ARI case as
we don't have to handle the missing function 0 in next_fn().

Let me sent you this variant before we abandon the -ENODEV return and
condition transforms.

True, we really do need to keep the ARI case separate.
