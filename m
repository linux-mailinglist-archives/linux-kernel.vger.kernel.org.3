The big difference is ACPI abstracts how to control power for a device. 
The OS just knows D0, D3, etc. states. For DT, there is no such 
abstraction. You need device specific code to do device specific power 
management.

DT requires device specific code to control a specific device. That 
belongs in the driver for that device.

Well, I don't think there is another way. People have tried to hack 
around this for years. There's the 'generic' bindings with never ending 
properties added one-by-one to try to handle new ctrl or timing needs 
for new device. Or there's the pseudo virtual platform device and driver 
to do power management on the side.

The only way generic control by the upstream (on the bus) device works 
is if there's a standard connector which has standard power supplies, 
reset, etc. which we know the timing for ('cause it's in the PCI spec).

That's basically requiring the firmware turn on everything before boot. 
Might work for some, but probably not everyone because they can't change 
firmware. There's also the issue that the kernel turns off unused clocks 
and regulators at late_initcall which is a problem if the PCI device's 
driver is a module.
