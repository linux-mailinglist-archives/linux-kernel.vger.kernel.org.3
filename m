Hi Avril & Adrian,
Thanks for your efforts. Could we have an agreement now --

1. enabling-cache and cmd23/reliable-write should be independent;

Here's what I found in the spec JESD84-B51:
 > 6.6.31 Cache
 > Caching of data shall apply only for the single block
 > read/write(CMD17/24), pre-defined multiple block
 > read/write(CMD23+CMD18/25) and open ended multiple block

Which means with CMD18/25+CMD12 (without using CMD23), the cache can 
also be enabled. Maybe this could be an evidence of the independence 
between enabling-cache and cmd23/reliable-write?

2. We don't consider supporting SD in this change.

Is there anything else I can do about this patch? Thanks again.
