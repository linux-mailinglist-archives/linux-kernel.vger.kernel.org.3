Actually, that is also the case for crng_slow_load() (see dest_buf there).

Indeed, crng_init should be set to 1 in that case.

However, if workqueues are not up and running (yet), it will fail.

New draft below!

Currently, if CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is enabled, mutliple calls
to add_bootloader_randomness() are broken and can cause a NULL pointer
dereference, as noted by Ivan T. Ivanov. This is not only a hypothetical
problem, as qemu on arm64 may provide bootloader entropy via EFI and via
devicetree.

On the first call to add_hwgenerator_randomness(), crng_fast_load() is
executed, and if the seed is long enough, crng_init will be set to 1.
However, no entropy is currently credited for that, even though the
name and description of CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER states otherwise.

On subsequent calls to add_bootloader_randomness() and then to
add_hwgenerator_randomness(), crng_fast_load() will be skipped. Instead,
wait_event_interruptible() (which makes no sense for the init process)
and then credit_entropy_bits() will be called. If the entropy count for
that second seed is large enough, that proceeds to crng_reseed().
However, crng_reseed() may depend on workqueues being available, which
is not the case early during boot.

To fix these issues, explicitly call crng_fast_load() or crng_slow_load()
depending on whether the bootloader is trusted -- only in the first
instance, crng_init may progress to 1. Also, mix the seed into the
input pool unconditionally, and credit the entropy for that iff
CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is set. However, avoid a call to
crng_reseed() too early during boot. It is safe to be called after
rand_initialize(), so use crng_global_init_time (which is set to != 0
in that function) to determine which branch to take.
