I hope we can find a better solution, but since the responsiveness
issue is a significant regression, I queued up a revert of
0e8ae5a6ff59 ("PCI/portdrv: Do not setup up IRQs if there are no
users") in case we don't find one.

If/when we get to the bottom of this, I'll replace the revert with the
solution.  0e8ae5a6ff59 appeared in v5.16, so we'll have to make sure
we fix that as well.
