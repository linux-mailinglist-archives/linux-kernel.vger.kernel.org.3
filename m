For -EBUSY, are you thinking of a specific usecase where that would
come in handy? I'm not really opposed to it, but couldn't convince
myself of the practical benefits of it, either.

Keep in mind that MAX_RECLAIM_RETRIES failed reclaim attempts usually
constitute an OOM situation: memory.max will issue kills and
memory.high will begin crippling throttling. In what scenario would
you want to keep reclaiming a workload that is considered OOM?

Certainly, proactive reclaim that wants to purge only the cold tail of
the workload wouldn't retry. Meta's version of this patch actually
does return -EAGAIN on reclaim failure, but the userspace daemon
doesn't do anything with it, so I didn't bring it up.

For -EINVAL, I tend to lean more toward disagreeing. We've been trying
to avoid arbitrary dependencies between control knobs in cgroup2, just
because it exposes us to race conditions and adds complications to the
interface. For example, it *usually* doesn't make sense to set limits
to 0, or set local limits and protections higher than the parent. But
we allow it anyway, to avoid creating well-intended linting rules that
could interfere with somebody's unforeseen, legitimate usecase.
