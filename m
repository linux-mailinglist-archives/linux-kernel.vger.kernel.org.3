Alas I can't deliver that. But Manivannan has done a testing on his
Qualcomm devices.

Normally fixes patches go before ahead of the rest of the series to
simplify the backporting procedure (makes Greg's life much easier).
Revertability has much less priority. In the worst case an additional
fixes patch is more preferable especially if the original patch has
been reviewed, accepted and most likely backported. Only if the patch
author didn't provide a fix then the reversion is proceeded. So I
wouldn't recommend to reshuffle the patches.

This series and another patchsets have been available for testing for
about two months now. There have been more than enough time to give it
a try and review.

Could you be more specific what it was complaining about? I haven't
got any relevant message in none of my emails.

Feel free to submit your comments. I'll take them into account in v3.

Basically any generic code change affects the dependent platforms. If
you don't see any exact issue in mind then I don't see any reason to
sustain the series any longer especially seeing it has been already
tested on an alternative platform.

As I noted this isn't good since I haven't noticed much activity for
the last two months. Alas Bjorn hasn't participated in the review
process either. I can offer a help with reviewing the patches
concerning the DW PCIe drivers since during the patchsets development
I've got a good notion regarding the DWC drivers and HW internals. But
it only concerns the DW PCIe Host/End-point code.

See my comment above regarding kbot.
