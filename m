We are allowing to overshoot the temperature by not capping the
power actors, but we have a safety net to not overshoot too much.
It's internal decision insdie IPA. Userspace would have to
re-implement whole IPA logic and take control over cooling
device states - which would contradict the decision from IPA
controlling the same thermal zone. The finding of coefficients
is by testing many values while running. The post processing
of the data (temp., power requests, frequency, etc) won't tell us
the the limits. We have to check them. That means the user-space tool
would have to re-implement major part of IPA, but also somehow
get the CPUs utilization, then use the obsolete user-space
governor API to experiment with them.

This feature is aimed for every user of the device, even w/o
expert knowledge in thermal/power. If vendor or OEM didn't
support properly the board, users could do this and they don't
have to be restricted (IMO).
Apart from that, I see vendors are rather interested in investing
in their proprietary solutions, not willing to share know-how
in open source power/thermal mechanisms. Then user is restricted
IMO in using the board. This might block e.g. research of some
PhD students, who have good ideas, but the restrictions of the platform
prevent them or cause the behavior of the board that they cannot
control. I would like to enable everyone to use fully the potential
of the HW/SW - even end-user.

Ideally, yes, I would also like to see that. As you said a few months
ago during review of my former patches, a lot of this 'sustainable
power' entries in DT are Linaro contribution. I wish vendors also
contribute, but c'est la vie.
