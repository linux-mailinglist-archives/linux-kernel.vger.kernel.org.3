I am afraid this is a difficult question and a short and concise answer 
is not possible...

The complexity of the locking is driven by concurrency and the data 
structures that are involved. The data structures (existing global iint 
rbtree, ns_status structure, and per namespace rbtree for ns_status) and 
how they are organized and connected (via linked lists) are a 
consequence of the fact that we need to be able to handle files shared 
between IMA namespaces (and the host) so that re-auditing, re-measuring 
and re-appraisal of files after file modifications or modifications of 
the security.ima xattr (by any namespaces) can be done efficiently. 
Furthermore, it helps to efficiently remove all the status information 
that an IMA namespace has kept for files it audited/measured/appraised. 
The goal was to make this as scalable as possible by having each 
namespace get out of the way of other namespaces by preventing them from 
locking each other out too much. The single biggest problem are files 
shared between IMA namespaces.

The best argument for the design I can come up with is the 'Big O 
notation' describing the time complexity of operations.


The existing global iint rbtree maintains IMA status information for 
each inode. Lookup and insertion of data into the gloab iint rbtreeÂ  is 
O(log(n)), thus optimal.

To accommodate re-auditing/re-measurement/re-appraisal, which is driven 
by resetting status flags, I connected a list of ns_status structures, 
in which each namespace maintains its status information for each inode, 
to the iint maintained in that global rbtree. The resetting of status 
flags is fast because traversing the list after a lookup in the tree is 
O(n). Lookup + resetting the flags therefore is O(log(n) + n). If the 
list didn't exist we would have to search all IMA namespaces for the 
inode to be able to reset the flags, resulting in O(n * log(n)) time 
complexity, which is of course much worse. So, the list of ns_status 
linked to an iint has a good reason: better time complexity to traverse 
the list and reset status flags. BesideÂ  that it also supports fast 
handling of deletion of files where the iint has to be delete from the 
global rbtree and the ns_status list it holds must also be deleted (each 
ns_status also needs to be delete from a per IMA-namespace rbtree then)


There's also a per-IMA namespace rbtree for each inode that serves two 
purposes:

a) Fast lookup of ns_status (O(log(n)) for an IMA namespace; at least to 
insert an ns_status into this tree we need not write-lock the iint tree 
but the initial iint creation required the write-locking of the iint tree

b) Maintaining a collection of inodes that the namespace has 
audited/measured/appraised for efficient deletion upon IMA namespace 
teardown: We can traverse this tree in O(n) time and determine which 
iints have no more namespace users and delete them from the iint tree.


Now the dilemma with this is that an ns_status structure is connected to 
a list hanging off the iint and on top of this it is part of an rbtree. 
And this is where the 'group locking' is coming from. What we need to 
prevent is that an ns_status is deleted from its iint list (when a file 
is deleted) while it is also deleted from the per-IMA namespace rbtree 
(when the namespace is deleted). Both must not be done concurrently. 
What is possible is that a group of threads may tear down namespaces and 
the other group may act on file deletion, but threads from both groups 
must not run concurrently.


Now we can at least look at two alternatives for the per-IMA namespace 
rbtree.

1) One alternative is to use a list instead of an rbtree. We would loose 
the fast lookup via the per IMA namespace tree and get O(n) lookup times 
but quick insertion into the list [O(1)]. We still would have the 
collection of inodes. And we would still have the dilemma that an 
ns_status would be connected to two lists, thus requiring the group 
locking. I don't think using a list instead of an rbtree is a solution.

2) We could try to get rid of the per-IMA namespace rbtree altogether 
and just use the global iint rbtree that exists today with a list of 
ns_status connected to its iints. If we do this we would loose the 
knowledge of which inodes a namespace has an ns_status structure for. 
The only way we would find this is by traversing the global iint tree 
(O(n)) and follow each iint list (O(m)) to see whether we find an 
ns_status holding information about the iint. The time complexity for 
this would be O(n*m) but much less than O(n^2). A downside would also be 
that we would have to keep a lock on the global iint rbtree while 
traversing it, thus locking out those that want to add inodes to the 
tree. On the upside it would allow us to get rid of the group locking. 
Lookup of an ns_status in the global iint tree would be O(n) + O(m) and 
insertion would be O(n) + O(1).


Certainly, the alternative is 2) with its own trade-offs. My guess is 
some sort of yielding could probably also be helpful there then to avoid 
blocking higher priority operations than deleting of a namespace.

We are traversing the per-namespace rbtree here and later on in this 
series (21/27) we try to determine which iints are now unused in the 
global iint tree and delete the iints there. Due to the locking that's 
necessary to remove the iint from the global rbtree all the ns_status 
are collected in this list here already now. True, in this patch here it 
is not necessary but in 21/27 it will be necessary to have them on this 
list. I had thought about merging the patches but its complex enough as-is.
