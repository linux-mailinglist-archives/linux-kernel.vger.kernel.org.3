Actually, both that and the node that contains it, i.e. pci@0,0.

Yes.  I use an assortment of PCIe endpoint devices for testing.

You'll find one in
"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/nvidia,tegra-pcie.txt", line
~240, although this
is a board DTS example.  They use "pci@0,0" for endpoint 02:00.0,
whereas I find "pci-ep" to
be more descriptive.

Note that  the "pci-ep@0,0" node is in the "example" section of
brcm,stb-pcie.yaml; but nothing
says it is required.  I believe it was added it because a reviewer
asked me to, but if I remember
incorrectly,  it does illustrate that "pcie@0,0" is not the endpoint
device node as many would think.

Note that the regression occurred because "pci@0,0" was missing, not
"pci-ep@0,0" as I first thought.

The only  reason one needs to describe this node is  when a regulator is
under the root port, in my case pci@0,0.  In the example this is

                            vpcie3v3-supply = <&vreg7>;

This was the entire reason behind the original patchset.

Yes.

Yes, we do not have the HW functionality to support hotplug.

The brcm_pcie_add_bus() function returned immediately and skipped linkup
when (!dev->of_node). That clause was removed from that function, which
is the true fix for the regression,  but you can see thiscondition
is still tested in pci_subdev_regulators_add_bus().

I added the "busno != 1" as an added precaution,
as the brcmstb RC driver only cares about pcie linkup and turning on
regulators when busno==1.

If this regulator mechanism becomes a feature any RC driver may use --
as it was in
v8 of the original patch but was moved to pcie-brcamstb only to avoid conflicts
with Pali's upcoming RC functionality improvements -- I would probably consider
removing the busno==1 clause.
