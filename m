I'm focused on the first series for now.

As I said, they're not 100% consistent, but they almost all end in
"pcie_ops".  Yours ends in "pcie_dw_ops", which is why I suggested
renaming to be similar to the others.

I don't want to make a huge deal about this, but I do want as much
similarity across drivers as possible.  I get that it doesn't benefit
*you*, but it's a huge benefit to everybody else.
