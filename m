Hello,

I did this experiment today with disabling record_times(), test_state()
loop and averaging worker, while only keeping groupc->tasks[] updates,
the results look promising.

Tejun suggested using a bitmap in task to remember whether the task is accounted
at a given level or not, which I think also is a very good idea, but I haven't
clearly figure out how to do it.

The above performance test result looks good to me, so I think we can implement this
per-cgroup "cgroup.psi" interface to disable/re-enable PSI stats from the start,
and we can change to a better implementation if needed later?

Thanks!
