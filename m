Well, it works partially. For more drivers SET method is working, but
GET method returns incorrect value. If your userspace application is
written in a way that does not retrieve from kernel current settings
then it has big probability that application works.

So, do you really want to remove support for these old flags completely?
That would of course break above applications.

Note that usage of BOTHER is problematic and in most cases highly
impossible if you are using glibc libc.so. BOTHER is incompatible with
glibc header files and so you can either include BOTHER/linux termios
file (exclusive) OR glibc header files.

New version of tcsetattr and ioctl_tty manpages would have documented
how to use BOTHER (it is currently in the manpages git).

Currently the only known option how to use BOTHER is to completely
reimplement all functions from "termios.h", provide custom "termios.h"
header file (and not use glibc termios.h nor any file which it includes)
and statically link this reimplementation into final application.

So in most cases BOTHER is not alternative to those old SPD flags even
for modern applications.
