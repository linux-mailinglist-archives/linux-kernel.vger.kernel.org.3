I'm confused here, I'm pretty aware that in-service I/O(as said pending
requests is the patchset) should be counted, as you suggested in v7, are
you still thinking that the way in this patchset is problematic?

I'll try to explain again that how to track is bfqq has pending pending
requests, please let me know if you still think there are some problems:

patch 1 support to track if bfqq has pending requests, it's
done by setting the flag 'entity->in_groups_with_pending_reqs' when the
first request is inserted to bfqq, and it's cleared when the last
request is completed. specifically the flag is set in
bfq_add_bfqq_busy() when 'bfqq->dispatched' if false, and it's cleared
both in bfq_completed_request() and bfq_del_bfqq_busy() when
'bfqq->diapatched' is false.

Thanks,
Kuai
