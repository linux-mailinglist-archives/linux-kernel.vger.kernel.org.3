I agree with the premise. Right now macOS does not actually power down
these devices as far as I know (except maybe sleep mode? not sure what
goes on then yet), but I think the hardware actually has an SD card
detect GPIO hookup that would allow us to entirely power down the SD
controller when no card is inserted. That would obviously be ideal.

FWIW, we do have the device nodes downstream [1]. I did in fact have to
add the SD one for the CD/WP inversion flags (and had to add driver
support for that too).

That said, as for how to make this happen in the PCI subsystem
properly... I think I'll defer to the maintainers' opinion there before
trying to hack something up ;)

Meanwhile, I guess I better get PCIe hotplug working, since doing it in
the driver isn't going to work without that first...
