So on 12/25/2020 (just before v5.11-rc1), you saw I/O errors after
resume from hibernate, and you apparently went to the trouble to
bisect it to 4257f7e008ea ("PCI/ASPM: Save/restore L1SS Capability for
suspend/resume").

We reverted 4257f7e008ea, and the revert appeared in v5.11-rc7.

I assume you re-applied 4257f7e008ea ("PCI/ASPM: Save/restore L1SS
Capability for suspend/resume") on top of something between v5.17-rc2
and v5.17-rc3, and you don't see those I/O errors.

It's possible something was fixed elsewhere between v5.11-rc1 and
v5.17-rc2, but I'm not really convinced by that theory.

I think it's more likely that something changed in BIOS settings or
other configuration, which means other people may trip over it even if
you don't see it.  Do you remember any BIOS updates, BIOS setup
tweaks, hardware changes, kernel parameter changes, etc?

If the problem really was fixed by some change elsewhere, it *should*
still happen on v5.11-rc1.  I think we should verify that and try to
figure out what the other change was.  People who want to backport the
L1SS save/restore will need to know that anyway.
