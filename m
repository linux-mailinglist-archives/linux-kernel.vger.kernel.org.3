No. I was saying that because pci_power_manageable() depends on the state not
being saved, we depended on it too ...

... but this solution gets us away from dependency. We'll make this change.

I don't know that Kai-Heng's case is due to this, but it's a fair reading of the
spec that downstream devices should be disabled first. We'll change the patch to
disable PTM on all devices. Thanks.
