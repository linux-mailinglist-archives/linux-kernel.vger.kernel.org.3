That only works if you have a single host bridge where you care about
I/O ports, or if you're willing to split up the single space across
the multiple host bridges, e.g., [io 0x0000-0x7fff] to one host
bridge, [0x8000-0xffff] to another.

I might be missing your point here, but multiple host bridges are
common on ia64, sparc, and (I think) powerpc.  It probably would be
feasible to make the struct resource address identical to the PCI bus
address for 64-bit MMIO space because they're both constrained to the
same-sized space.

But doing it for the PCI 32-bit non-prefetchable space would be an
issue because there's usually RAM in that area of CPU address space,
so we'd have to reserve a hole for PCI, put the MMIO in the hole, then
split the MMIO space across all the host bridges.  This sparc system
has 16 host bridges, so even if we had no hole, each one could only
have 256MB of identity-mapped non-prefetchable space:

  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x800000000000-0x80007effffff] (bus address [0x00000000-0x7effffff])
  pci_bus 0001:00: root bus resource [mem 0x801000000000-0x80107effffff] (bus address [0x00000000-0x7effffff])
  ...
  pci_bus 000f:00: root bus resource [mem 0x839000000000-0x83907effffff] (bus address [0x00000000-0x7effffff])

Is this feature used by Linux?  I guess it would require some generic
mechanism drivers could use to get the desired endianness?  I don't
know whether such a thing exists.
