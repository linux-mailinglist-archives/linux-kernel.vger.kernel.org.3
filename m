Note that your worst-case is 32 levels (maximum supported userns
nesting) where each ima namespace defines a separate policy.

So make sure you don't run into locking issues when hierarchically
processing rules. So far I think it's fine since the locks aren't held
across the hierarchial walk but are dropped and reaqcuired for each
level.

But that could still mean a lot of contention on iint->mutex since this
lock is global, i.e. in this context: for all ima namespaces. You might
want to consider coming up with some rough ideas for how to solve this
_if_ this becomes a problem in the future.

Just to repeat the point from earlier reviews, all those functions need
to be guaranteed to call from syscall context. Functions that operate on
files have different semantics.

Since we're starting to be fairly along I would ask you to please write
detailed commit messages for the next revision.

I would also like to see all links for prior versions of this patchset
in the commit message since the discussion has been fairly extensive so
for this series it makes a lot of sense. So something like:

Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/$MSGID (v1)
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/$MSGID (v2)
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/$MSGID (v3)
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/$MSGID (v4)
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/$MSGID (v5)
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/$MSGID (v6)
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/$MSGID (v7)
Signed-off-by: meh
Signed-off-by: mih
Signed-off-by: muh

I find that extremely pleasant in case we need to revisit things later.
(Technically you can get the same by searching lore via the final link
but I find it be pretty pleasing to just copy+paste directly from the
commit message to the discussion for the earlier patch.)
