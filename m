The reason why BIOS is not programming these values is because when VMD is
enabled the ports are not visible to BIOS. This would apply to any BIOS
including those used by ChromeOS.


And because BIOS doesn't see these ports ...

... we cannot rely on POLICY_DEFAULT for their ASPM setting. This leaves the
devices with ASPM disabled.

That said, we do honor the PCI aspm_disabled flag which is tied to both the FADT
bit and module parameter. So we only enable it if OS control is allowed.

We do have to set a default in place of the missing BIOS configuration. We chose
to do ASPM_STATE_ALL, allowing all ASPM settings supported by the endpoint.

I don't know if that would happen. It certainly would not be used as intended.

I'll seek more clarification from firmware team on the LTR. But again the fact
that switches can reduce the reported LTR seems to allow for at least some
decoupling of the endpoint LTR value from the topology.
