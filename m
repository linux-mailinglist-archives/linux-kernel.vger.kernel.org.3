No worries, sounds like you're getting everything sorted out :)

This patch dependency thing feels like a one-time or at least unusual
situation.  Unless it becomes a problem, I think it makes sense to
keep the drivers/pci umbrella instead of carving bits out of the

Even if I continue to merge everything under drivers/pci, maybe we
should consider an update like this just so you get cc'd on updates to
these files?
