All drivers that care about power regulators turn them on before
link-up, but typically those regulators are described directly under
the host bridge itself.

IIUC the difference here is that you have regulators described under
Root Ports (not the host bridge/Root Complex itself), so you don't
know about them until you've enumerated the Root Ports.
brcm_pcie_probe() can't turn them on directly because it doesn't know
what Root Ports are present and doesn't know about regulators below
them.

So I think brcm_pcie_setup() does initialization that doesn't depend
on the link or any downstream devices, and brcm_pcie_start_link() does
things that depend on the link being up.  Right?

If so, "start_link" might be a slight misnomer since AFAICT
brcm_pcie_start_link() doesn't do anything to initiate link-up except
maybe deasserting fundamental reset.  Some drivers start the LTSSM or
explicitly enable link training, but brcm_pcie_start_link() doesn't
seem to do anything like that.

brcm_pcie_start_link() still does brcm_pcie_set_outbound_win().  Does
that really depend on the link being up?  If that only affects the
Root Port, maybe it could be done before link-up?
