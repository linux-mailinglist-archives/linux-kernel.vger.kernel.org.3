Note that mem_cgroup_handle_over_high() has its own allocator throttling grace 
period, where it bails out if the penalty to apply is less than 10ms. The 
reclaim will still happen, though. So throttling might not happen even for 
roughly MEMCG_CHARGE_BATCH-sized allocations, depending on the overall size of 
the cgroup and its protection.

Thanks, I was going to comment on v1 that I prefer to keep the implementation 
of mem_cgroup_handle_over_high if possible since we know that the mechanism has 
been safe in production over the past few years.

One question I have is about throttling. It looks like this new 
mem_cgroup_handle_over_high callsite may mean that throttling is invoked more 
than once on a misbehaving workload that's failing to reclaim since the 
throttling could be invoked both here and in return to userspace, right? That 
might not be a problem, but we should think about the implications of that, 
especially in relation to MEMCG_MAX_HIGH_DELAY_JIFFIES.

Maybe we should record if throttling happened previously and avoid doing it 
again for this entry into kernelspace? Not certain that's the right answer, but 
we should think about what the new semantics should be.
