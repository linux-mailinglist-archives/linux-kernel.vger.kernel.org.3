Yeah, I think that's perfectly fine and I liked that part of your
series.
I would introduce struct ima_namespace together with a first or
multiple easy member(s) to move into as one patch. And then individual
patches for other, larger members as you did.

- One patch to introduce struct ima_namespace including init_ima_ns and
  a single member that can be moved into it converting all accesses to
  that member to access it via struct ima_namespace.
- Individual patches for other members as you did now.

I would recommend starting to pass down the ima_namespace down right
away so you don't need to do it later when you actually introduce the
ima namespace proper. This could probably be done as part of the first
patch that introduces struct ima_namespace.

If I'm right this will make the actual semantic changes to enable ima
namespaces proper easier to review as they don't contain the jitter that
comes with introducing a new argument into functions.

I answered that in the other mail. Just put them in the cover letter. :)

It did enable ima namespace support before that. It only wasn't
reachable from userspace since securityfs couldn't be mounted and a
custom policy applied.
But from a pure implementation/development perspective namespacing had
already taken place in the first patch.
Say, if I wanted to debug something in the patch series and compiled in
the middle of the previous patch series then I would have already had to
deal with per-userns ima namespaces before userspace could do anything
with them. So the regression and bug potential that comes with that had
already been fully realized so to speak.

What I want is to have this be one step: namespacing is fully
implemented and turned on at the same time.

> suggest?

No, securityfs can be mounted and just stay empty until ima starts
creating files in there in the last patch. I see no harm in that at all.
