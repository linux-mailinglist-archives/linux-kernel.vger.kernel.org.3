You cannot set a measurement rule in the namespace. That is prevented 
per 9/20: ima: Only accept AUDIT rules for IMA non-init_ima_ns 
namespaces for now.

Also, with the tests that I have done with IMA namespaces I have not 
seen any 'evmctl ima_measurement ...' failures.

Have you been able to cause the IMA namespace to do measurements? It 
would be an easy thing to move the tpm_chip into the ima_namespace as 
well, but per 9/20 this shouldn't be necessary at this point.

Yes, this series allows you to log into the system log and along with 
this extend the TPM PCR.
