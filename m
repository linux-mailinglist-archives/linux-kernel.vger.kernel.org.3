Ok yea.  I got confused by step 6 in sec 6.30.2.

Yes cool!

I think I disagree.  Even if we do that and an FLR comes before the last read
the last read could be 0's.

I think the interpretation of the data needs to happen above this and if an FLR
happens during this read we are going to have other issues.

But I can add the check if you feel strongly about it.

NP I'm not always following this either.

I thought that meant the hardware (the DOE instance) must clear those bits
within 1 second?

Oh...  yea.  Jonathan?  We discussed this before and I was convinced it worked
but I think Lukas is correct here.

Should we drop the special case in pci_doe_irq_handler() and just clear the
status always?  Or should we wait and clear it is pci_doe_abort_start?
