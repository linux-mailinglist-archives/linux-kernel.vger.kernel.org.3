Ok, so I now know why the inode->i_size is 0 during replay phase (for file foo).
This is because inode->i_disksize is not really updated until after the
ext4_writepages() kicks in, which in this case, won't happen (for file foo)
when we are doing fsync on file bar. And hence fsync on file bar won't also
not ensure the delalloc blocks for file foo get's written out.


In fact this above information was something that I was assuming it all wrong.
Earlier I was of the opinion that fast_commit still pushes _all_ the dirty
pagecache data of other files to disk too (which is incorrect) and the only
performance gains happens via less writes to disk (since we write less metadata
on disk).

But I think what really happens is -
In case of fast_commit when fsync is called on any file (say bar), apart from that
file's (bar) dirty data, it only writes the necessary required metadata information
of the blocks of others files (in this case file foo) which are already allocated.
(which in this case was due to fzero operation).
It does not actually allocate the delalloc blocks due to buffered writes of any
other file (other than for file on which fsync is called).

This happens in
ext4_fc_perform_commit() -> ext4_fc_submit_inode_data_all() ->
jbd2_submit_inode_data -> jbd2_journal_submit_inode_data_buffers() ->
generic_writepages() -> using writepage() which won't do block allocation for
delalloc blocks.

So that above is what should give the major performance boost with fast_commit
in case of multiple file writes doing fsync. :)

@Jan/Harshad - could you please confirm if above is correct?

Right. So then yes, we should not depend on inode->i_size during replay phase,
since it might have an entry in fast_commit area which is still only partially
correct (or in some transient state w.r.t i_disksize).

Thanks, yes it did help.
