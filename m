The _ON method of the ACPI power resource associated with the root
port doesn't work correctly.

Strictly speaking, it is not a fix for the above commit.

It is a workaround for a firmware issue uncovered by it which wasn't
visible, because power management was not used correctly on the
affected system because of another firmware problem addressed by
14858dcc3b35.  It wouldn't have worked anyway had it been attempted
AFAICS.

I was thinking about CCing this change to -stable instead.

Not really.  The former applies to the entire platform and not to an
individual device.

Yes, I agree that this needs to be cleaned up.

We have this check in pci_bridge_d3_possible():

if (bridge->is_hotplug_bridge && !pciehp_is_native(bridge))
            return false;

but this only applies to the case when the particular bridge itself is
a hotplug one using ACPI hotplug.

If ACPI hotplug is used, it generally is unsafe to put PCIe ports into
D3cold, because in that case it is unclear what the platform
firmware's assumptions regarding control of the config space are.

However, I'm not sure how this is related to the patch at hand.
