To clarify, after the kexec load, the IMA measurement list contains the
kexec'ed kernel image measurement.  The TPM was also extended with that
measurement.  Nothing prevents verifying the IMA measurement list at
this point, before the kexec execute, though depending on policy it
might result in additional measurements.

The IMA "pcr=" policy rule option allows specifying a different PCR
than the default IMA_MEASURE_PCR_IDX.

To summarize, with CONFIG_IMA_ARCH_POLICY enabled, both measurements -
kexec'ed kernel image, boot_aggregate - are being added to the IMA
measurement list and extended into the default TPM PCR.  Measuring the
kexec'ed kernel image and extending the TPM with the measurement
happens at some point before the system is rebooted.  The
"boot_aggregate" is the first measurement after boot/soft boot.

thanks,

Mimi
