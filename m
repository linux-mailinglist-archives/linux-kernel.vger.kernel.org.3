It is true.

Agreed.

They look good to me.

In the meantime, I recalled that nvme wanted to leave the device in D0
and program it into an internal low-power state in some cases which
would be disturbed by disabling PTM later on (a config space write
would kick the device out of the internal low-power state).

So it looks like it would be better to disable PTM as the first thing
in pci_pm_suspend() before calling the driver's suspend callback
(which may be nvme suspend), but then we'd need to save the original
PTM status and restore it during the subsequent resume.  That could be
done as early as in pci_pm_resume_noirq(), but I think the cleanest
way would be to add a new bit to struct pci_device for that.
Alternatively, we can drop the $subject patch, so ptm_enabled still
only means that it has been enabled during enumeration and it can be
used to restore the original PTM status during resume.

Agreed.

I think so.

Yes, it is, modulo the above observations.
