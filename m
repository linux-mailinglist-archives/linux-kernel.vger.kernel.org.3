Yeah, please be always as explicit as possible, so that it is impossible
to get it wrong. Then a reader of your patch saves time from seeking e.g.
the current name of the data structure. Just dumb things down as far as
you can.

Commit messages have a dual function:

1. They *lower* the barrier to look into a code change, which helps
the patches get any attention.
2. Proper commit messages save tons of time from the maintainer, when
you have revisit years old commits, e.g. when bisecting a bug.

Comparing to e.g. Github the key difference is this: in Github you have
commits and issues. In kernel commit is both issue and the commit bundled
together. Therefore, every commit also needs to have a "bug report"
included.

BR, Jarkko
