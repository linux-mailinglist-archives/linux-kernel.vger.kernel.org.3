The signatures are generated by evmctl by this code here, which works 
for RSA and ECDSA and likely also ECRDSA:

https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/ima-evm-utils/ci/master/tree/src/libimaevm.c#l1036

    if (!EVP_PKEY_sign_init(ctx))
         goto err;
     st = "EVP_get_digestbyname";
     if (!(md = EVP_get_digestbyname(algo)))
         goto err;
     st = "EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_signature_md";
     if (!EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_signature_md(ctx, md))
         goto err;
     st = "EVP_PKEY_sign";
     sigsize = MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE - sizeof(struct signature_v2_hdr) - 1;
     if (!EVP_PKEY_sign(ctx, hdr->sig, &sigsize, hash, size))
         goto err;
     len = (int)sigsize;

As far as I know, these are not raw signatures but generate the OIDs for 
RSA + shaXYZ or ECDSA + shaXYZ (1.2.840.10045.4.1 et al) and prepend 
them to the hash and then sign that.

There's a hash algorithm identifier in the xattr in the header, which is 
prepended to the bytes of the actual signature. This hash algo identifer 
tells IMA which hash to use on the file data so that subsequent 
signature verification with the same hash works. That same hash 
identifier is then again embedded in the signature using the OID and 
thus has to match on the signature verification level.

The effectively double hashed data via calc_tbs_hash() above is not 
good. calc_tbs_hash() is unnecessary.

On the evmctl level the signature should be created from the digest 
retrieved via ioctl() [or similar I suppose] from fsverity on the file 
and fsverity presumably then also says what type of hash this is. So, 
fsverity ioctl response of hash + size of hash and hash_algo become 
input to the evmctl snippet above. On the kernel level the data from 
fsverity_get_digest() should be all it takes to verify against an xattr 
created by evmctl as described.
