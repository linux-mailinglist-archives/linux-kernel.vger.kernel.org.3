Well, I guess an argument could be made that in such case users should
rather run e2fsck and *that* should remove the error from the filesystem.
It isn't like we allow other metadata corruptions to be papered over by
hiding them. I know we have this policy "corrupted dirs can be deleted"
since basically forever but in retrospection it does not seem particularly
good one to me.

So I agree this would be a sane option as well but honestly I'm not sure
the complications are worth it. IMHO "corrupted dir is undeletable" is OK
policy because simple things are harder to break ;)...
