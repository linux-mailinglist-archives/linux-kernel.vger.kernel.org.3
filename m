Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker. Top-posting for once,
to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Hey, what's up here? Or was this regressions fixed already?

H.J. Lu: reminder, this is caused by a patch of yours.

Mike, if you have a minute: '925346c129da' ("fs/binfmt_elf: fix PT_LOAD
p_align values for loaders") in 'next' contains a 'Fixes:' tag for the
culprit of this regression, but I assume it fixes a different issue?

Ciao, Thorsten
