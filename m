Do we have anything more specific than nr_dying_descendants? I was
thinking about an interface which would provide paths and stats for dead
memcgs. But I have to confess I haven't really spent much time thinking
about how much work that would be. I am by no means against adding memcg
information to the page owner. I just think there must be a better way
to present resource consumption by dead memcgs.
