Read/write of vmpr stats is always done in context of vmpr->sr_lock
which is also the case for this patch. So not sure how the read is racy
?.

Ok, not sure if I am inferring correctly as to how how that would be
useful. Can you please provide some more context.

The primary motivation for this patch was to expose the vmpressure stats
to user space that are available with cgroup-v1 but not with cgroup-v2
AFAIK

Userspace may very well want to know the amount of memory that was
partially reclaimed even though write to "memory.reclaim" returned
'-EBUSY'. This feedback can be useful info for implementing a retry
loop.

Sure sounds reasonable to me.

Agree, I will address that in v2.
