I assume you're referring specifically to making this optional in the
DT:

    /* PCIe endpoint */
    pci-ep@0,0 {
            assigned-addresses =
                <0x82010000 0x0 0xf8000000 0x6 0x00000000 0x0 0x2000>;
            reg = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0>;
            compatible = "pci14e4,1688";
    };

I don't really understand what's going on here, but I assume this
describes a [14e4:1688] device, which the PCI database says is a
NetXtreme BCM5761 10/100/1000BASE-T Ethernet
(https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/14e4/1688)

Why do you *ever* need this stanza?  "git grep pci-ep
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/" says no other DT has one.

If the link does come up, I assume normal PCI enumeration would
discover the [14e4:1688] or whatever device is plugged into a CM4
socket, and it would read and assign BARs as needed.  Why do we need
to describe any of this in the DT?

If the link doesn't come up, it looks like you set the "refusal_mode"
so subsequent config accesses fail gracefully instead of with a CPU
abort.

[Tangent: since you never clear "refusal_mode", I assume there's no
possibility of hot-adding a device.  A device must be put in the slot
before power-up, right?]

It's a big leap from "DT endpoint is optional" to "bus->number == 1 if
DT endpoint is missing" (if that's even what it means).  Help me
connect the dots here.

I *guess* this is really saying "we only want to bring the link up for
RPs"?

And "bus->number == 1" assumes the RP is on bus 0, there's only one
RP, and that RP's secondary bus is 1?  So it's only in that case
(we're adding the secondary bus of the RP), that we need to manually
bring up the link?

Is this related?  It doesn't *look* related to making the DT endpoint
optional.
