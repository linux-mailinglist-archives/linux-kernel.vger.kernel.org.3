Wow, you are right. I've missed the epf drivers completely. They don't
take the buffer size alignment into account. This patch and the
range-related patch most likely will regress both of these drivers.(
Alas they can't be fixed that easily.

1) drivers/pci/endpoint/functions/pci-epf-test.c retrieves size from
the user-space by means of an ioctl implemented in the
drivers/misc/pci_endpoint_test.c char-device driver (see what is
written at the PCI_ENDPOINT_TEST_SIZE offset). It doesn't make
sure that aside with the base address the size needs to be also
aligned.

2) drivers/pci/endpoint/functions/pci-epf-ntb.c uses the size based on
the NTB entity. It's either Door-Bell entry or a Memory Window. If the
Door-bell/MSI-X part can be more or less easily fixed, the MW-part
can't because the PCIe-bus part of the EP-function implementation
doesn't provide such information. After fixing that I would have also
needed to fix the drivers/ntb/hw/epf/ntb_hw_epf.c driver so the
callback method mw_get_align() would return the size alignment
constraint.

So to speak without corresponding HW at hand I won't be able to
successfully fix them.

Don't bother with re-developing our code. Since I can't fix the
denoted client drivers we have no choice but to do as you say and drop
the size alignment check. Thanks for pointing this out.
