Refer to memory.swappiness for cgroup, this new interface better be independent.

For THP, the word 'QoS' maybe too absolute, so let's describe it in the way why user
need THP: seeking for better memory performance.
Yes as you said THP may be quite overhead, and madvise() may not be suitable some time
(see PR_SET_THP_DISABLE https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html).

So I think this is just the reason why we need the patch: give user a method to use
THP with more precise range(only the performance sensitive containers) and reduce
overhead.
