yes I think it's a violation to the spec.

ok I think it'll help. Do you mean something like this based on this patch:

Partly. It'll also terminate the VF users.
Think that I attach the VF of hns to a VM by vfio and ping the network
in the VM, when doing FLR the 'ping' will pause and after FLR it'll
resume. Currenlty The driver handle this in the ->reset_{prepare, done}()
methods. The user of VM may not realize there is a FLR of the PF as the
VF always exists and the 'ping' is never terminated.

If we remove the VF when doing FLR, then 1) we'll block in the VF->remove()
until no one is using the device, for example the 'ping' is finished.
2) the VF in the VM no longer exists and we have to re-enable VF and hotplug
it into the VM and restart the ping. That's a big difference.

It involves a remove()/probe() process of the VF driver and the user of the VF
will be terminated, just like the situation illustrated above.
