All existing callers to process_measurements call it at least once with 
current_cred().

The only problem that I see where we are accessing the IMA namespace 
outside a process context is in 4/16 'ima: Move delayed work queue and 
variables into ima_namespace' where a delayed work queue is used. I 
fixed this now by getting an additional reference to the user namesapce  
before scheduling the delayed work and release it when it ran or when it 
is canceled (cancel_delayed_work_sync()) but it didn't run.
