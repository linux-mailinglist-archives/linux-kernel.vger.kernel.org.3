These explicit ranges in DT are probably ignored as they are invalid.
You can see them (0xffffffffffffffff) in dmesg. MEM and I/O resources
are parsed in pci-mvebu.c driver in mvebu_pcie_parse_request_resources()
function.

Here is relevant dmesg output:

From kernel point of view they are root ports. But in reality every of
these root port is on separate bus segment, but kernel pci-mvebu.c
driver merges all these segments/domains into one host bridge and put
all root ports into bus 0.

Here is lspci -tvnn output with topology:

Buses 1, 2 and 3 represents mPCIe cards, all of them are in reality in
separate bus segments and on different HW host bridges. So they do *not*
share access to config space, do *not* share INTx interrupts, etc...

Yes, exactly. I do not know now all restrictions. At least there are
fixed number of memory slots and each has to be of size 2^N. They are
dynamically assigned by kernel mbus driver at time when somebody updates
BASE/LIMIT registers. And that kernel mbus driver takes care to split
non-aligned window size to more slots of size 2^N. And resources are
shared from pool with other HW parts (e.g. DMA), so other drivers loaded
in kernel can "eat" available slots before pci-mvebu and then there does
not have to be nothing to allocate for PCI.

But most Armada boards do not have exported all peripherals from SoC,
unconnected are disabled in DT and therefore exhaustion should not
happen.

I do not understand APCI model very well and I'm in impression that it
is impossible to represent mvebu in ACPI.
