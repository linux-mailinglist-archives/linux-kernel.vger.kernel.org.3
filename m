(just back from holiday; well, briefly, going away for a few days soon)

We shouldn't generalise what maintainers wwould accept or not. We decide
on a case by case basis. With speculative execution mitigations, for
example, we try to do as much as we can in the kernel but sometimes
that's just not possible, hence an EL3 call and we'd rather have this
standardised (e.g. custom branch loops to flush the branch predictor if
possible from the normal world, secure call if not).

You mention PSCI but that's not working around broken hardware, it was a
concious decision from the start to standardise the booting protocol and
CPU power management.

Now this PCI SMC protocol was simply created because hardware did not
comply with another PCI standard that has been around for a long time.
As with the speculative execution mitigations, we'd rather work around
broken hardware in the kernel first and, if it's not possible, we can
look at a firmware interface (and ideally standardised). Do you have an
example where we cannot work around the PCI hardware bugs in the kernel
and EL3 firmware involvement is necessary?

So, in summary, Arm Ltd proposing a new standard because hardware
companies can't be bothered with an existing one is not an argument for
accepting its support in the Linux kernel. This PCI SMC conduit is not
presented as a hardware bug workaround interface but rather as an
alternative to ECAM (and, yes, the kernel maintainers can choose not to
support specific "standards" in Linux).
