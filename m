IMHO I'm not sure how these benefits are a result of what looks largely
like a rewrite and rename of seq_buf... Seems to me like it should be
possible to stick with seq_buf and add features to it instead of doing a
replace and remove. As I understand the kernel community, that is always
the preferred practice and would certainly reduce a lot of churn in this
series. But I haven't looked at the entire series and it's not really
something I'm responsible for, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

It was changed to a heap allocation recently because my pending patch
set will add a path where this code is called in an atomic context and
cannot sleep. Simplest solution was stack allocation instead of tracking
GFP context for the atomic path.
