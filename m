I don't want to redesign this whole thing.  I just want a crisp
rationale for the commit log.

All other drivers (exynos, imx6, rw-rockchip, histb, qcom, tegra194,
tegra, rockchip-host) have regulators for downstream PCIe power
directly under the RC.  If putting the regulators under an RP instead
is the direction of the future, I guess that might be OK, and I guess
the reasons are:

  1) Slot or device power regulators that are logically below the RP
     should be described that way in the DT.

  2) Associating regulators with a RP allows the possibility of
     selectively controlling power to slots/devices below the RP,
     e.g., to power down devices below RP A when suspending while
     leaving wakeup devices below RP B powered up.

I think in your case the motivating reason is 2).

Your commit log for "Add mechanism to turn on subdev regulators"
suggests that you want some user control of endpoint power, e.g., via
sysfs, but I don't see that implemented yet except possibly via a
"remove" file that would unbind the driver and remove the entire
device.
