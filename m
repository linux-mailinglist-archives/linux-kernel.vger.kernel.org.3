Yes? If you're referring to the "authenticated code module" (as part
of senter's internal procedure) it's part of hardware/firmware and
beyond the scope of software/boot loader/kernel.

Maybe I'm confused. I thought the proposal was that unnecessary and
untrusted code (Trenchboot) is inserted into "pre kernel launch"
(between UEFI firmware and Linux's efi-stub), and then (during "post
kernel launch") kernel calls a callback provided by "pre kernel
launch" (Trenchboot); thereby coupling pre-launch (Trenchboot) and
post-launch (Linux kernel) more than has ever be done before.

I also assumed that if the 1st kernel runs for 6 months and then
starts a 2nd kernel via. "kexec()" ; then the 2nd kernel would call
the callback provided by "pre 1st kernel launch from 6 months ago".

[1] doesn't provide any useful information. How does a kernel know
that the callback provided by boot loader actually measures what it's
supposed to measure, or even does anything at all?

[1] doesn't provide any useful information. Dynamic root of trust is
only useful for detecting if a measurement changed; so if the
measurement was always nonsense from the beginning and never changes
it becomes worse than nothing.

[1] doesn't provide any useful information. Senter and skinit don't
provide a method for kernel to detect that (e.g.) a MiTM boot loader
has always measured a forgery and has changed unmeasured code in a
different way every time you boot.
