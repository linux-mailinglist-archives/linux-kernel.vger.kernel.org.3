Low limit protection is considered soft because it doesn't provide any
guarantee. I will be ignored (and that will be reported to the userspace
via LOW event) if there is nothing reclaimable in the scope of the
reclaimed hierarchy. An alternative would be OOM actually.

No, it should behave consistently for any external memory pressure.
A reclaimed memcg can apply different constraint depending on the root
of the reclaim. Your solution is considering root to be root_memcg.
