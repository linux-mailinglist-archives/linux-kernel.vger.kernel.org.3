Ah, right, it does still matter in terms of whether we can trust our 
*own* integrity. I was thinking that it's OK since by this point the 
IOMMU driver should have reset the hardware and allocated new 
configuration tables etc. such that any previous modifications wouldn't 
matter, but of course the theoretical worst case is that the malicious 
device manages to corrupt the kernel code in memory just before that 
point to subvert the IOMMU driver itself. Got it, thanks again!

So yes, I think we *do* want to abstract that through the IOMMU API (and 
I'll follow up with our ACPI folks internally to check whether anyone's 
thought about this for Arm-based systems yet). Gosh, this is becoming 
quite the adventure, but it's all for good in the end :)

Robin.
