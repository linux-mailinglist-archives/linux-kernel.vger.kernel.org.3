I don't understand this patch clearly.

I understand your proposal not to count a group as with pending =
requests, in case no child process of the group has IO, but only its =
child groups have pending requests.

So, entities here are only queues for this patch?

If they are only queues, I think it is still incorrect to remove the =
group from the count of groups with pending IO when all its child queues =
are deactivated, because there may still be unfinished IO for those =
queues.

Am I missing something?

Thanks,
Paolo
