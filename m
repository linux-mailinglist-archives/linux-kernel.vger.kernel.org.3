Right.

But from the HW perspective they still are in the same hierarchy below
the original host bridge.

vmd.c actually exposes things hidden by the firmware and the point of
the patch is to still let the firmware control them if it wants/needs
to IIUC.

Well, the firmware needs to know how stuff works to hide it in the
first place ...
