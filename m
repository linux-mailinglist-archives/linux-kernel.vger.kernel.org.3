Unusual or not, there is a pin for both DE and RE. DE is muxed with RTS.

And the IP synthesis only part of the picture, in general case, it'd
also matter that there's something connected to that RE (i.e.,
an RS485 transceiver).

On the board I'm testing with, I can also turn RS485 on/off from BIOS
which makes the pins (mainly RE) behave differently.

I initially had additional version check here while developing this
patch series but it seemed to not provide any added value due those
other factors that need to be considered.
