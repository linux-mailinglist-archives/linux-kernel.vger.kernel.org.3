They do exist, but are probably rare.  Even on x86 where multiple host
bridges are now fairly common, and the hardware probably supports a
separate 64K port space for each, the ones I've seen split up a single
64K I/O port space so each bridge only gets a fraction of it.  I'm not
sure Linux would even support multiple spaces.  I do know ia64
supports multiple port spaces (see __ia64_mk_io_addr()), so we could
have something like this:

  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0xffff]
  pci_bus 0001:00: root bus resource [io  0x10000-0x1ffff] (bus address [0x0000-0xffff])

I guess the question is whether we want to reserve port 0 and MMIO
address 0 as being "invalid".  That makes the first space smaller than
the others, but it's not *much* smaller and it's an unlikely
configuration to begin with.

But at the same time, it adds another slightly weird special case in
the already full-of-special-cases alloc code, and I'm somewhat averse
to things like that.

We do have the IORESOURCE_UNSET flag bit that could possibly be used
in pci_iomap_range() instead of testing for "!start".  Or maybe
there's a way to allocate address 0 instead of special-casing the
allocator?  Just thinking out loud here.
