Thanks, that very good explanation!

Exactly, there is no need to change all callers now.
1. You just add rename existing code and add argument:

  syscon_regmap_lookup_by_compatible_mmio(...., unsigned long flags);

2. Add a wrappers (with old names):
syscon_regmap_lookup_by_compatible() {
  syscon_regmap_lookup_by_compatible_mmio(..., SYSCON_IO_DEFAULT);
}

3. and finally slowly convert the users where it is relevant.

Just one more thing. I was rather thinking out loud, instead of
proposing a proper solution about clients defining speed. I am still not
sure if this is correct approach, because actually the regmap provider
knows the best whether it is slow or fast. Clients within SoC should
know it, but what if one client asks for fast regmap, other for slow? Or
not every client is updated to new API?

Another solution would be to add such property to the bus on which the
syscon device is sitting. Although this is also not complete. Imagine:

syscon <--ahb-fast-bus--> some bus bridge <--apb-slow-bus--> syscon consumer

Although your original case also would not be accurate here.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
