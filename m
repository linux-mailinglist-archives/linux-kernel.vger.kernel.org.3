Oh, sorry, I totally misread that.

But I wonder about the fact that probe and resume do these in
different orders:

  brcm_pcie_probe
    brcm_pcie_setup                          # setup
    pci_host_probe
      ...
        brcm_pcie_add_bus
	  pci_subdev_regulators_add_bus
	    regulator_bulk_enable            # regulators on
	  brcm_pcie_linkup                   # linkup

  brcm_pcie_resume
    regulator_bulk_enable                    # regulators on
    brcm_pcie_setup                          # setup
    brcm_pcie_linkup                         # linkup

Maybe pci_subdev_regulators_add_bus() could be done directly from
brcm_pcie_probe() instead of in brcm_pcie_add_bus()?  If the
regulators must be directly under the root port node in DT, it seems
like it would be reasonable to look for them in the probe path, which
seems like what pcie-dw-rockchip.c, pcie-tegra194.c, and
pcie-rockchip-host.c do.

Or maybe brcm_pcie_resume() should enable the regulators after
brcm_pcie_setup() so it's the same order as the probe path?
