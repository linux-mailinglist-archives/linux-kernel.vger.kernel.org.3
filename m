Will do.

I will leave rcu_read_lock() in for now. We can worry about the proper 
way to remove it or document it later on.

Fetching of llist head is done by an atomic xchg(). So it has all the 
necessary barrier.

Iterating the nodes of the llist and clearing them are not atomic. That 
is the reason I put a comment previously about a possible race. However 
that race is benign. Making it atomic does not eliminate the race as the 
iostat update data themselves are synchronized separately with sequence 
lock.

Sure. I will need to think about that and put a proper comment there.
