Only one algorithm needs to be broken.  For example, SM3 has the same hash
length as SHA-256.  If SM3 support were to be added to fs-verity, and if someone
were to find a way to find an input that has a specific SM3 digest, then they
could also make it match a specific SHA-256 digest.  Someone might intend to
sign a SHA-256 digest, but if they are only signing the raw 32 bytes of the
digest, then they would also be signing the corresponding SM3 digest.  That's
why the digest that is signed *must* also include the algorithm used in the
digest (not the algorithm(s) used in the signature, which is different).
