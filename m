My comment is for 'do not expect to return any I/O error to frontend users',
and I still think it is just one soft requirement, and no one can
guarantee there isn't any error for frontend users really.

But what if people sends nothing and starts to reboot, then hang forever without
monitor_work involved.

It is pretty easy to fail all in-queue requests when user recovery
can't move on.

But you have to define what is 'crash', otherwise how can you define
what to be recovered?

So far please just define the crash as the whole daemon being dead
abnormally(without sending stop command) if you don't have better idea.

Actually I was thinking the use case of container-ware ublk device when
ADMIN privilege requirement can be removed, so people can do whatever
they want in ublksrv. But sooner or later, request timeout needs to be
considered for real ublk use case.
