Right, sorry. That makes sense. If we have a realistic possibility, then
I agree that making it discoverable in firmware is the best option. My
point was just that we can't rely on Windows-focused vendors to
implement it.

I think it's a great idea to try and find some sort of standardized
solution for OP-TEE and other interested projects similar to it, but we
still have to use a workaround for the Qualcomm WoA devices we have :(

Nevertheless, I'm happy to provide some input for a generic solution,
although I'm not sure I'm the best person to talk to about this.

Right. I think you (either in your patches or mails) already mentioned
having an integer ID for the implementation (or maybe implementation +
vendor?). Apart from that, I think it might also make sense to have a
bit-field similar to efi.runtime_supported_mask that tells the kernel
which functions are taken over.

So with that you could call efivars_register() based on the firmware
table in the driver for linaro,optee-tz (I assume) whether for qcom,tee
(or whatever we'd call that) we'd have to hard-code it based on some
platform/model identifier.
