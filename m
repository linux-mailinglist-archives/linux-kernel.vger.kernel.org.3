It's partially my fault: I was thinking (and to some extent still are)
that using objcg is not the best choice long-term and was pushing on the
idea to used per-memcg lru vectors as intermediate objects instead.
But it looks like I underestimated the complexity and a potential overhead
of this solution.

The objcg-based approach can solve the problem right now and it shouldn't
bring any long-term issues. So I asked Muchun to revive the patchset.

Thanks!
