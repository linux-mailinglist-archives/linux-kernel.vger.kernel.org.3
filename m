From my discoveries it really seems just a bug in 2_1_0 with enabling
the phy clk BEFORE setting the require bit...

Moving the bulk_prepare_enable after the bit is set makes everything
works as it should... If you want I can send a patch as that is clearly
a bug and currenty we have a workaround in place...

(with the patch the workaround can be dropped aka we even remove a line
of code)

Considering it won't change anything and pci 2_1_0 use the bulk api...
calling each clock separately will actually makes things less
readable... Sooo think it's just a line to drop and a code move.
