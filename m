So a company (kadalu) has forked gluster, then removed the gluster
quota implementation because of undefined "major performance
problems" and then implemented their own quota thing that stores
disk usage information in extended attributes. And:

	Advised method is adding quota limit info before writing any
	information to directory. Even otherwise we donâ€™t need quota
	crawl for updating quota-limit, but do a du -s -b $dir and
	write the output into xattr.

Yeah, that's broken by design.

Oh, look at that:

	Just run statfs() on all dirs which has Quota set, and send
	a flag to update status of quota xlator through internal
	xattr mechanism if quota limit exceeds for a directory! This
	can run once in 5 or 10 seconds, or even lesser frequency if
	the quota limit is huge!

That's pretty broken, too. Doesn't scale out, either...

Cheers,

Dave.
