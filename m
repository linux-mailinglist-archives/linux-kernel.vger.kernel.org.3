You have already suggested it in email [1] but apparently you are _not_
maintainer of mvebu pci controller. get_maintainer.pl for part about
which you have talked in [1] says:

$ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f drivers/pci/controller/pci-aardvark.c
Thomas Petazzoni <thomas.petazzoni@bootlin.com> (maintainer:PCI DRIVER FOR AARDVARK (Marvell Armada 3700))
"Pali Rohár" <pali@kernel.org> (maintainer:PCI DRIVER FOR AARDVARK (Marvell Armada 3700))
Lorenzo Pieralisi <lorenzo.pieralisi@arm.com> (supporter:PCI NATIVE HOST BRIDGE AND ENDPOINT DRIVERS)
Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org> (reviewer:PCI NATIVE HOST BRIDGE AND ENDPOINT DRIVERS)
"Krzysztof Wilczyński" <kw@linux.com> (reviewer:PCI NATIVE HOST BRIDGE AND ENDPOINT DRIVERS)
Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com> (supporter:PCI SUBSYSTEM)
linux-pci@vger.kernel.org (open list:PCI DRIVER FOR AARDVARK (Marvell Armada 3700))
linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org (moderated list:PCI DRIVER FOR AARDVARK (Marvell Armada 3700))
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (open list)

So I do not have to remove anything, you are _not_ on that list.
On the other hand, Thomas Petazzoni is on this list...

The only _toy_ here is your broken mvebu board which your ego was unable
to fix, and you have put it into recycling pile [2] and since than for
months you are trying to reject every change or improvement in mvebu
drivers and trying to find out a way how to remove all mvebu code, like
if you were not able to fix your toy, then broke it also to all other
people. You have already expressed this, but I'm not going to search
emails more and find these your statements.

Sorry, I'm stopping here. This is just a prove that you are not
qualified in reviewing mvebu code.
