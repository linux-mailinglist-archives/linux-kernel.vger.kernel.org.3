I see.

I am afraid that it is more complicated.

If the parent process might have gone through a KLP transition
then also the transition might have finished and klp_target_state might be
KLP_UNDEFINED. We must not set TIF_PATCH_PENDING in this case.

Now, we might race with klp_complete_transition() at any stage. It
might be before or after setting task->patch_state = KLP_UNDEFINED.
And it might be before or after setting klp_target_state =
KLP_UNDEFINED.

The great thing is that we could not race with
klp_update_patch_state() that would be migrating current because
we are current.

So, the easiest solution would be to copy the flag from current
once again here:


/* Called from copy_process() during fork */
void klp_copy_process(struct task_struct *child)
{
	/*
	 * The parent process may have gone through a KLP transition since
	 * the thread flag was copied in setup_thread_stack earlier.
	 * Copy also the flag once again here.
	 *
	 * The operation is serialized against all klp_*_transition()
	 * operations by tasklist_lock. The only exception is
	 * klp_update_patch_state(current). But it could not race
	 * because we are current.
	 */
	if (test_tsk_thread_flag(current, TIF_PATCH_PENDING))
		set_tsk_thread_flag(child, TIF_PATCH_PENDING);
	else
		clear_tsk_thread_flag(child, TIF_PATCH_PENDING);

	child->patch_state = current->patch_state;
}


I hope that I did not miss anything. It is Friday.

Best Regards,
Petr
