Yes, that's somewhat entangled with the IOMMU bus ops stuff, so I'll 
probably get to the point of having to revisit it in a couple of months 
or so. These patches are off the bottom of that stack from my first 
attempt, where the aim was to make the current ops the same shape first 
so that the switch is then easier to reason about (particularly in terms 
of sounding out any issues with the hooking up of dev->dma_coherent, 
although your series will now be taking most of the load off there).

Cheers,
Robin.
