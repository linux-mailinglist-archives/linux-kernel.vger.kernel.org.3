I agree. What I am suggesting is to additionally scan reparented pages
first under memory pressure. These pages were used by a dead
descendant, so there is a big chance they aren't being used anymore or
they are used by a different memcg, in this case recharging these
pages (if possible) might put the memcg back below its limit. If a
memcg reaches its limit and undergoes reclaim because of reparented
pages it isn't using, this is bad. If during reclaim we keep those
pages and reclaim other pages that are actually being used by the
memcg (even if colder), is arguably worse. WDYT?
