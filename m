But it's still a question whether such an easily triggerable interface
should be used for a heavy procedure like the DSP firmware load.
e.g. calling the standard request_firmware() API directly from a
control callback doesn't sound like a good idea at all.  The similar
argument is applied to the dynamic addition/removal of other controls
followed by a kctl callback.
