Hi Born,

So you know this patch comes from our platform power management team to address several VMD bugs
affecting power. The VMD driver developers are already cc'd but also adding Francisco from the VMD
team who can maybe help clarify.

I don't know if there is another way to tell what the BIOS is _not_ doing. DID is tied to the SoC so
it's our best method of inferring this. We know the firmware team has said they will not support
programming these values for the mentioned platforms so there's no BIOS update coming to change
this. But to be sure, we can add a check first to confirm that these values have not been programmed
(ASPM is disabled and LTRs are 0).

In VMD mode the root ports under the VMD bridge are used specifically to manage storage devices. So
only storage devices should be attached to these ports.

The answer I just learned is yes. It may be possible to have a switch too. So both of those would
need to be addressed though I'm note quite sure how yet.

Okay

I am not an LTR expert either, but LTRs are "conglomerated" per spec. Switches subtract their own
latency from the minimum LTR of the downstream ports and report this conglomerated value upstream.
So the value will decrease as needed to account for latency in the hierarchy.
