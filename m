Using Waydroid which is android run via LXC, on android 10 the bug comes when trying to use video playback. I know of issues on android 11 but have not yet had the chance to get the logs from it. the issue does not occur in Linux kernel 5.16 series. but does occur on linux 5.17. the issue is confirmed on both Arch's linux-zen 5.17.1.zen1-1 kernel as well as some users reporting a fedora kernel with the issue.
