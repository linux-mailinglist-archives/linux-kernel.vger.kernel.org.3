* So consider mounting securityfs _without this patch applied_:

  mount -t securityfs /sfs
  
  and assume we only have a single user that creates a file "foo" via
  
  securityfs_create_file()
  {
  	lookup_one_len();	// first dget()
  	dget();			// second dget()
  }
  
  now assume that user at some point calls
  
  void securityfs_remove()
  {
  	if (d_is_dir(dentry))
  		simple_rmdir(dir, dentry);	// first dput()
  	else
  		simple_unlink(dir, dentry);	// first dput()
  	dput(dentry);				// second dput()
  }

* Now consider mounting securityfs _with this patch applied_:

  securityfs_create_file()
  {
  	lookup_one_len();	// first dget()
  }
  
  void securityfs_remove()
  {
  	dget();					// second dget() 
  	if (d_is_dir(dentry))
  		simple_rmdir(dir, dentry);	// first dput()
  	else
  		simple_unlink(dir, dentry);	// first dput()
  	dput(dentry);				// second dput()
  }
