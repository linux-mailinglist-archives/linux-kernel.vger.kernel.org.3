Yes, I saw that two references were being taken.  And near as I can tell,
the second one was never being dropped.  So if you tell me that before this
patch the dentries are never freed, then I'm happy.  Otherwise, I'm
bothered the fact that no matching dput is being deleted in the code (to
match the extra dget being removed).  So where is the code where the final
dput was happening, and is it the d_delete() you're adding which is making
it so that that dput won't be called now?
