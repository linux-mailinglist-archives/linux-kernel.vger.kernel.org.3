Yes, that's why I as vague about what to switch to if the counter is
non-zero, i.e. "something else, *possibly* hashedâ€¦".

For this MAC address usecase it's entirely sufficient to be able to
distinguish if the system was closed at all, i.e. if the counter is
zero or is non-zero. Because that would already be great for a policy
of "hash it in a stable way from /etc/machine-id, if counter == 0" +
"use random MAC once counter > 0".

Such a MAC address policy I think should probably even be the new
default in networkd, if we could implement it. For that we'd need a
single bit of info from the kernel, indicating whether the sysem was
cloned at all. i.e. if the vmgenid uuid is different from the one the
system booted up first.
