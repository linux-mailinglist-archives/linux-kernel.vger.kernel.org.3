I think it would be good to make the first patch change as little as
possible to make it easier to analyze, then possibly test for
hypervisor when changing this behavior.

I see the Boolean equivalence, but it's difficult to verify that the
consequences are equivalent because the new code has the extra "!fn &&
!dev" test in the middle.

Fair enough, and I agree that "this is the next fn" is a nice final
return.  In general I think it's good to return either an error or the
next fn as soon as it is known.  It makes it harder to analyze if the
return value has already been determined but we have to mentally pass
over subsequent tests that don't affect it.

Yes, I agree that's weird.  Usually I prefer "for" loops over
"do ...  while", but this might be a case where it makes sense --
we *always* want to call pci_scan_single_device() once, and
"do ... while" would accomplish that without any fuss.  It might even
allow us to keep the 0 return value as the termination condition,
which would be nice because fn could stay unsigned and it would reduce
the size of this patch.

I'm hoping we can end up with something like this:

  unsigned int next_fn(bus, dev, fn, mf)
  {
    if (ari(bus)) {
      if (!dev)
	return 0;
      return PCI_ARI_CAP_NFN();
    }

    if (fn >= 7)
      return 0;

    if (mf)
      return fn + 1;

    if (hypervisor())
      return fn + 1;

    return 0;
  }

  int pci_scan_slot(...)
  {
    unsigned int fn = 0, mf = 0;

    do {
      dev = pci_scan_single_device(bus, devfn + fn);
      if (dev && dev->multifunction)
	mf = 1;
      fn = next_fn(dev, fn, mf);
    } while (fn);
  }

This would be minimal change to next_fn(): just add the "mf"
parameter, which removes a lot of the confusing "dev" and "!dev"
testing, and add the "fn >= 7" to remove the implicit "% 8 == 0"
failure case.

Then the jailhouse/s390 patch would trivially add the new hypervisor
case, which is clearly separated from everything else.

Oops, I don't think we can do this directly because in the ARI case,
fn is basically 8 bits wide so can be 0-255.
