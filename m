Thanks for the explanation, this is really helpful.

Matthew suggested this already, but can you explain why handling this
in a callback is not an option? I'd by sympathetic to specifying a
Linux specific protocol that can be grabbed before EBS() but can be
invoked after (but not, say after SetVirtualAddressMap(), to keep
things simple). That should allow us to call back into firmware to
perform the secure launch right before handing over.

My other suggestion, to use a minimal EFI environment just to boot the
kernel, still seems viable to me as well, but it would boil down to
mostly the same, thing, i.e., to inject an intermediate boot stage
between the call to the firmware's EBS() and calling the entrypoint of
the kernel proper. What I do like about this approach is that the EFI
stub could execute unprivileged, which means the secure launch kernel
could track *exactly* what the EFI stub is doing in terms of memory
accesses and protocol invocations, which seems a bit more robust than
the approximation of 'this might be interesting enough to measure'
that the industry seems to have settled on.

The reason I am not willing to lock down the stub<->kernel boot
protocol is because it doesn't scale: currently, the discussion is
about x86, which is a bit different because we already so many ways to
boot it, but for other architectures, this is going to create a huge
maintenance burden: arm64, RISC-V and now LoongArch are all adding EFI
boot support and are looking to support ACPI, SMBIOS and other
features as well, and these are all gated on EFI boot, which requires
booting via the stub.

I'm not eager to kick this can down the road and go with something
that inevitably implies either specifying and maintaining a whole
array of internal protocols as external ABI, or revisiting this
discussion and coming up with two different ways to do DRTM depending
on whether you are running x86 or not.

So how will the above translate into meaningful and fair feedback in
response to proposed changes to this documented stub<->kernel handover
protocol, once the need arrives to make changes? Is this super
cautious person going to be the one NAKing everything just because he
is super cautious?

Pardon the skepticism, but I am really reluctant to let this cat out
of the bag if the requirements are so vague and there doesn't seem to
consensus on the scope of DRTM.

Another thing I missed is how these systems are supposed to carry out
the tasks that the stub currently handles: Matt mentioned setting
MemoryOverwriteRequest, but there is also TPM event log handling, and
other bits and pieces. Are you saying this is all going to be part of
this boot protocol as well?

I think you are missing my point here, tbh. What I am suggesting here
is to run a separate, minimal EFI implementation, which has its own
EBS() which is unrelated to the firmware one. Matthew pointed out some
issues with this approach, but the fundamental idea is that it is just
an impedance matcher that looks like EFI to the EFI stub, but is
really just a loader with a memory map and some config tables.

The requirement for this came up in the confidential computing space,
but for bare metal, it seems having a tiny EFI-like shim that can only
boot a Linux kernel (or other EFI-like payloads with no dependencies
on the driver model or other UEFI/PI bloat) might be useful here as
well, especially because it would be completely generic from the EFI
side of things, as opposed to creating yet another project with
intimate knowledge of struct bootparams, device trees, where in memory
the kernel may be loaded on architecture X, where in memory the initrd
may be loaded on architecture X, etc etc.

So the bottom line is that we will have to make this work with EFI
boot one way or the other, but skipping the EFI stub altogether is
really not an option, unless you want to carry the burden of keeping
your code in sync with the kernel. Locking this down as external ABI
is not acceptable to me.

Thanks,
Ard.
