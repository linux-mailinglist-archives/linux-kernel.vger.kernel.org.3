Hmm, I think I made a mistake when I put this patch in the middle and
applied other stuff on top of it.  I'd like to just postpone this
patch while we work out these issues, but I think it's not completely
trivial since it's in the middle.  I'll try to straighten this out
next week.

I haven't looked at the code again, but will just offer the opinion
that unnecessary differences in structure often hide bugs, and they're
always minor speed bumps for readers.
