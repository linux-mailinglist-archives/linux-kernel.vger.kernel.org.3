That's a good point.  We have a similar situation with some Arm
devices and U-Boot.  Let me try to explain a bit.

There's code plugged in in OP-TEE and U-Boot atm which allows you to
store EFI variables on an RPMB.  This is a nice alternative if your
device doesn't have any other secure storage,  however it presents
some challenges after ExitBootServices, similar to the ones you have
here.

The eMMC controller usually lives in the non-secure world.  OP-TEE
can't access that, so it relies on a userspace supplicant to perform
the RPMB accesses.  That supplicant is present in U-Boot and
Get/SetVariable works fine before ExitBootServices.  Once Linux boots,
 the 'U-Boot supplicant' goes away and we launch the linux equivalent
one from userspace.  Since variable accessing is a runtime service and
it still has to go through the firmware we can't use those anymore
since U-Boot doesn't preserve the supplicant, the eMMC driver and the
OP-TEE portions needed in the runtime section(and even if it did we
would now have 2 drivers racing to access the same hardware).  Instead
U-Boot copies the variables in runtime memory and
GetVariable/GetNextVariable still works, but SetVariable returns
EFI_UNSUPPORTED.

I've spent enough time looking at available solutions and although
this indeed breaks the EFI spec, something along the lines of
replacing the runtime services with ones that give you direct access
to the secure world, completely bypassing the firmware is imho our
least bad option.

I have an ancient branch somewhere that I can polish up and send an
RFC [1],  but the way I enabled that was to install an empty config
table from the firmware.  That empty table is basically an indication
to the kernel saying "Hey I can't store variables, can you do that for
me".

Is there any chance we can do something similar on that device (or
find a reasonable way of inferring that we need to replace some
services).  That way we could at least have a common entry point to
the kernel and leave out the DT changes.
