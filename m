Yes. I managed to confuse myself there by being too paranoid about how
to distinguish things on platforms which need to support both ways, i.e.
x86 when XEN is enabled.

Right. See above. That's why I went back to my notes, did some more
research ...

This is about IMS, right. PCI/MSI[x] is handled today because the writes
to the MSI/MSI-X message store can be trapped.

It's today part of the arch/subarch specific PCI/MSI domain to deal with
quirks above the IOMMU level. As we can't proliferate that into the new
endpoint domain, that needs to be done as a shim layer in between which
has no real other functionality than applying the quirks. Yes, it's all
pretty. Welcome to my wonderful world.

It will need some more than that, e.g. mask/unmask and as we discussed
quite some time ago something like the irq_buslock/unlock pair, so you
can handle updates to the state from thread context via a command queue
(IIRC).

No.

Hehe.

Via some cookie, reference whatever as discussed in the other
mail. We'll bikeshed the naming once I get there :)

It's helping to keep the existing stuff including the !irqdomain parts
sufficiently self contained so I can actually change the inner workings
of msi domains without going back to any of these places (hopefully).

That's only one part of it. Look how the address is retrieved.

Thanks,
