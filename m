Hmm. I thought we were good as well, but Lukas is correct in saying
the interrupt status bit isn't cleared (which is 'novel' give the associated
bit to tell you what the interrupt means will be cleared). 

I'm not sure I want to think around the race conditions that result...

I don't think it matters.  pci_doe_irq_handler() seems a little cleaner.

I've not figured out completely if there are races however...

It is set when no already set and we get transitions of any of the following:
- DOE error bit set (this can't happen until abort so no race here)

- Data Object Ready bit is set: Can this happen with the DOE error set? I don't
  immediately see language saying it can't. However, I don't think it can
  for any of the challenge response protocols yet defined (and there are other
  problems if anyone wants to implement unsolicited messages)

- DOE busy bit has cleared - can definitely happen after an abort (which is
  fine as nothing to do anyway, so we'll handle a pointless interrupt).
  Could it in theory happen when error is set? I think not but only because
  of the statement  "Clear this bit when it is able to receive a new data
  object."

So I think we are fine doing it preabort, but wouldn't put it past a hardware
designer to find some path through that which results in a bonus interrupt
and potentially us resetting twice.

If we clear it at the end of abort instead, what happens?
Definitely no interrupts until we clear it. As we are doing query response
protocols only, no new data until state machine moves on, so fine there.

So what about just doing it unconditionally..

+	case DOE_WAIT_ABORT:
+	case DOE_WAIT_ABORT_ON_ERR:
+		pci_read_config_dword(pdev, offset + PCI_DOE_STATUS, &val);
+
+		if (!FIELD_GET(PCI_DOE_STATUS_ERROR, val) &&
+		    !FIELD_GET(PCI_DOE_STATUS_BUSY, val)) {

	here...

+			/* Back to normal state - carry on */
+			retire_cur_task(doe_mb);

This feels a little bit more 'standard' as we are allowing new interrupts
only after everything is back to a nice state.
