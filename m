Thanks, I agree we should improve shutdown times. I tried a while ago, but
lost track to follow up at the time. Here's the reference, fwiw, though it
may be out of date :):

  http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-nvme/2014-May/000826.html

The above solution is similiar to how probe waits on an async domain.
Maybe pci can schedule the async shutdown instead of relying on low-level
drivers so that everyone implicitly benefits instead of just nvme? I'll
double-check if that's reasonable, but I'll look through this series too.
