IIUC, you're proposing something like this:

  deassert PERST#
  if (device advertises PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_DLLLARC) {
    poll until PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_DLLLA is set
  } 
  wait 100ms
  issue config request

I'm sure the spec would have said "if the device advertises
PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_DLLLARC, wait 100ms after PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_DLLLA is set"
if that were the intent, because that's the obvious wording.

But the spec calls out > 5 GT/s links specifically, and the physical
encoding changed significantly for those links (128b/130b encoding
instead of 8b/10b, etc), so it's plausible that they may require more
time for training.

Hotplug ports have always been required to advertise
PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_DLLLARC, and if they only support 5 GT/s or less, they
would not require more training time.

So I'm inclined to decide based on the max link speed instead of
PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_DLLLARC.  pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() does
something similar.

If we decide based on PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_DLLLARC, I guess the down side is
that we'll wait longer than necessary for ports like gen2 hotplug
ports.  Probably not a huge deal, since we only wait an extra link
training time, but why do it differently than what the spec says?
Would it make the implementation significantly simpler?
