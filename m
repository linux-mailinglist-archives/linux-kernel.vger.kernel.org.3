After looking at all the call sites again, there is no real usage for
this local index variable.

If anything needs the index of a descriptor then it's available in the
descriptor itself. That won't change because the low level message write
code needs the index too and the only accessible storage there is
msi_desc.

So the "gain" would be to have a pointless 'unsigned long index;'
variable at all usage sites.

What for? The usage sites should not have to care about the storage
details of a facility they are using.

So it might look odd in the first place, but at the end it's conveniant
and does not put any restrictions on changing the underlying mechanics.

Thanks,

        tglx
