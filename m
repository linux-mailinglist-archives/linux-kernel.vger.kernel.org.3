Based on TMA_metrics-full.csv version 4.3 at 01.org:
    https://download.01.org/perfmon/
Events are still at version 7:
    https://download.01.org/perfmon/BDW-DE
Json files generated by:
    https://github.com/intel/event-converter-for-linux-perf

This adds TopdownL1_SMT metrics to bdwde-metrics.json as
generated by the extract-tmam.py script.

Tested:
...
  6: Parse event definition strings                                  : Ok
  7: Simple expression parser                                        : Ok
...
  9: Parse perf pmu format                                           : Ok
 10: PMU events                                                      :
 10.1: PMU event table sanity                                        : Ok
 10.2: PMU event map aliases                                         : Ok
 10.3: Parsing of PMU event table metrics                            : Skip=
 (some metrics failed)
 10.4: Parsing of PMU event table metrics with fake PMUs             : Ok
...
 68: Parse and process metrics                                       : Ok
...
 88: perf stat metrics (shadow stat) test                            : Ok
 89: perf all metricgroups test                                      : FAIL=
ED!
 90: perf all metrics test                                           : FAIL=
ED!
 91: perf all PMU test                                               : Ok
...
The failures/skips relate to:
event syntax error: '{arb/event=3D0x84,umask=3D0x1,metric-id=3Darb!3event!2=
0x84!0umask!20x1!3/,arb/even..'
                     \___ Cannot find PMU `arb'. Missing kernel support?
