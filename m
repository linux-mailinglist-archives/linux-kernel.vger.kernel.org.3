I see in the subject and the commit message:

   "Fix leak"
   "may be leaked"
   "to be leaked"
   "would cause leak"

But the discussion suggests that nobody sees any real leak. I would
like to make this clear in the commit message.

Well, I still believe that this is just a cargo cult. And I would prefer
to finish the discussion about it, first, see
https://lore.kernel.org/all/YbmlL0ZyfSuek9OB@alley/

Note that klp_init_*_early() functions iterate through the arrays
using klp_for_each_*_static. While klp_free_*() functions iterate
via the lists using klp_for_each_*_safe().

We should not need the pre-early-init check when the lists include only
structures with initialized kobjects.

Otherwise, I like the idea to do module_get() before
klp_init_patch_early(). I was never happy with the "hidden"
side effect.

I am also fine with calling klp_free() when the early init fails
if we agreed that it is a good practice. I just do want to pretend
that it fixes a leak what nobody sees any leak.

Please, wait few days until the discussion finishes before sending v3.

Best Regards,
Petr
