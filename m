That counter and limit didn't turn out well. I liked the analogy to
writeback (and dirty limit) better.

My understanding would be to have all memory.stat entries as you
propose, no extra .current counter and the .max knob for zswap
configuration.

Thanks for the explanation. I guess there's no simple tranformation of
in-kernel available information that'd allow a more semantic
configuration of this value. The rather crude absolute value requires
(but also simply allows) some calibration or responsive tuning.

I admit I missed that.

Then I'm only concerned about a situation when there's a single deep
memcg that undergoes both workingset_refault() and zswap querying.
The latter (bare call to cgroup_rstat_flush()) won't reset
stats_flush_threshold, so the former (or the async flush more likely)
would attempt a flush too. The flush work (on the leaf memcg) would be
done twice even though it may be within the tolerance of cumulated
error the second time.

This is a thing that might require attention in the future (depending on
some data how it actually performs). I see how the current approach is
justified.
