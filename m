The difference is "where" the key is coming from.  In the builtin use-
case or the post build insert-sys-cert case, the kernel image is
signed, or re-signed, and the kernel image signature is verified.  The
root of trust is straight forward - secure boot with a HW root of trust
up to and including verifying the kernel image signature, then
transition to the builtin keys.

Keys on the "machine" keyring are not part of that signature chain of
trust, requiring them to be handled differently, more carefully.  At
least from an IMA perspective, one way of doing so is by loading a root
CA key, defined as a KeySigning cert, onto the "machine" keyring.  All
other certs would be loaded via userspace either onto the "secondary"
or "ima" keyrings.

This satifies all of the above requirements, even allowing users to
selectively authorize 3rd party certificates to verify kernel modules.

Limiting the change to just the IMA keyring is insufficient.  For this
reason, choosing to load all of the MOK keys onto the "machine" keyring
needs to be independently configurable and thoroughly explained.
