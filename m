If your system has ACPI, I think "pci=biosirq" and "acpi=noirq" are at
best distractions from finding the real problem.

This path has to do with ancient x86 and BIOS history, which I know
very little about.  If I were going to do something about these
messages, here's what I would do.  Maybe it's too aggressive; I dunno.
