I'm surprised this went so long unnoticed / unreported.

Could it be users relied on that implicit affinity reset?

This should apply only to tasks that were extracted out of the root
cgroup, no? (OK, those are all processes practically.)

(Even without your second patch, the scope should be limited because of
src_cset==dst_cset check in cgroup_migrate_prepare_dst().)

One could also argue that for such processes, cgroup hierarchy should be
first configured and only then they start and set own affinity.

I'm uneasy with the occasional revert of this flag, i.e. the task who
set their affinity would sometimes have it overwritten and sometimes
not (which might have been relied on, especially with writes into
cpuset.cpus).
(But I have no better answer than the counter-argument above since
there's no easier way to detect the implicit migrations.)

Also, is there similar effect with memory binding?

Thanks,
Michal
