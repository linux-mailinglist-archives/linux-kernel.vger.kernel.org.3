No worries.

The PCD in question has the following note:

# NOTE: User must NOT set NX protection for EfiLoaderCode /
EfiBootServicesCode / EfiRuntimeServicesCode. <BR>

Any idea whether this is easily reproducible with OVMF? Restricting
the loader from creating executable regions seems rather daft, so we
should at least report this, and preferably fix it in EDK2.

Fair enough. So EfiLoaderCode is not the right type.

OK

Now you're going too fast. One does not necessarily imply the other.

Given that this issue is specific to EDK2 based firmwares, would it be
possible to fix this using DXE services instead? In particular, could
we use

gDS->SetMemorySpaceAttributes()

to ensure that the regions have executable permissions?
