I'd argue that asm-generic/io.h uses the definitions from RISC-V, but 
the result is the same ;).

The general idea is that the IO itself is pretty generic for a handful 
of ports, they just need to be decorated with some fences (or whatever 
the ISA calls them) before/after the load/store.  Those are the 
__io_p{b,a}{r,w}() macros, which are in riscv's io.h.  IIRC they stand 
for something like Port{Before,After}{Read,Write}.
