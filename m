Right. And that means that cgtoup_name can go off the rail and wander
through memory correct?

I do not really see how a bit lock could prevent memcg from going away.
On the other hand I think RCU read lock should be sufficient to keep the
memcg from going away completely.

I do not mind inaccurate information. That is natural but reading
through a freed memory can be really harmfull. So this really need to be
sorted out.
