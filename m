Take a look at the vsprintf.c conversion if you want to see big 
improvements. Also, %pf() is another thing that's going to enable a lot 
more improvements.

I did it that way because I didn't want to touch unrelated code more 
than was necessary - just doing a direct conversion. Heap allocation 
would probably make sense here, but it's not my code.

All seq_buf uses are fully converted to printbuf in this patch series, 
and seq_buf is removed.

There is a lot of non seq_buf code that still uses raw char * pointers 
and lengths that should be converted to printbuf, but this patch series 
already does a lot of that and I'm not trying to boil the oceans today... :)
