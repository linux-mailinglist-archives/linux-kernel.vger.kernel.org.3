Considering the amount of memory and "normal" cgroup usage (I guess we
can agree that delegated subtrees do not count their cgroups in
thousands) is this really something that is worth bothering with?

I mean, these patches are really small and not really disruptive so I do
not really see any problem with them. Except that they clearly add a
maintenance overhead. Not directly with the memory they track but any
future cgroup/memcg metadata related objects would need to be tracked as
well and I am worried this will get quickly out of sync. So we will have
a half assed solution in place that doesn't really help any containment
nor it provides a good and robust consumption tracking.

All that being said I find these changes rather without a great value or
use.
