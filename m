That's a very good summary Ted, thanks.

Our rationale behind not supporting the migration was always the fact
that we felt that backup was absolutely necessary before operation like
this. When you already have up-to-date backup available you might as
well create a fresh ext4 file system with all the advantages it brings
and recover data from said backup. I think this is still a very
reasonable approach.

I have no doubt it was useful featrure in the early days of ext4, but I
think we're well past that. Any attempt to rework or fix the feature
assumes it's still useful and has it's users today and into the future.
I very much doubt that, so let's test it. Let's start a year long
deprecation window.
