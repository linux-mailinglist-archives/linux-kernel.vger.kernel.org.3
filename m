TLDR
====
The current page reclaim is too expensive in terms of CPU usage and it
often makes poor choices about what to evict. This patchset offers an
alternative solution that is performant, versatile and
straightforward.

Benchmark results
=================
Independent lab results
-----------------------
Based on the popularity of searches [01] and the memory usage in
Google's public cloud, the most popular open-source memory-hungry
applications, in alphabetical order, are:
      Apache Cassandra      Memcached
      Apache Hadoop         MongoDB
      Apache Spark          PostgreSQL
      MariaDB (MySQL)       Redis

An independent lab evaluated MGLRU with the most widely used benchmark
suites for the above applications. They posted 960 data points along
with kernel metrics and perf profiles collected over more than 500
hours of total benchmark time. Their final reports show that, with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs), the above applications all performed
significantly better for at least part of their benchmark matrices.

On 5.14:
1. Apache Spark [02] took 95% CIs [9.28, 11.19]% and [12.20, 14.93]%
   less wall time to sort three billion random integers, respectively,
   under the medium- and the high-concurrency conditions, when
   overcommitting memory. There were no statistically significant
   changes in wall time for the rest of the benchmark matrix.
2. MariaDB [03] achieved 95% CIs [5.24, 10.71]% and [20.22, 25.97]%
   more transactions per minute (TPM), respectively, under the medium-
   and the high-concurrency conditions, when overcommitting memory.
   There were no statistically significant changes in TPM for the rest
   of the benchmark matrix.
3. Memcached [04] achieved 95% CIs [23.54, 32.25]%, [20.76, 41.61]%
   and [21.59, 30.02]% more operations per second (OPS), respectively,
   for sequential access, random access and Gaussian (distribution)
   access, when THP=always; 95% CIs [13.85, 15.97]% and
   [23.94, 29.92]% more OPS, respectively, for random access and
   Gaussian access, when THP=never. There were no statistically
   significant changes in OPS for the rest of the benchmark matrix.
4. MongoDB [05] achieved 95% CIs [2.23, 3.44]%, [6.97, 9.73]% and
   [2.16, 3.55]% more operations per second (OPS), respectively, for
   exponential (distribution) access, random access and Zipfian
   (distribution) access, when underutilizing memory; 95% CIs
   [8.83, 10.03]%, [21.12, 23.14]% and [5.53, 6.46]% more OPS,
   respectively, for exponential access, random access and Zipfian
   access, when overcommitting memory.

On 5.15:
5. Apache Cassandra [06] achieved 95% CIs [1.06, 4.10]%, [1.94, 5.43]%
   and [4.11, 7.50]% more operations per second (OPS), respectively,
   for exponential (distribution) access, random access and Zipfian
   (distribution) access, when swap was off; 95% CIs [0.50, 2.60]%,
   [6.51, 8.77]% and [3.29, 6.75]% more OPS, respectively, for
   exponential access, random access and Zipfian access, when swap was
   on.
6. Apache Hadoop [07] took 95% CIs [5.31, 9.69]% and [2.02, 7.86]%
   less average wall time to finish twelve parallel TeraSort jobs,
   respectively, under the medium- and the high-concurrency
   conditions, when swap was on. There were no statistically
   significant changes in average wall time for the rest of the
   benchmark matrix.
7. PostgreSQL [08] achieved 95% CI [1.75, 6.42]% more transactions per
   minute (TPM) under the high-concurrency condition, when swap was
   off; 95% CIs [12.82, 18.69]% and [22.70, 46.86]% more TPM,
   respectively, under the medium- and the high-concurrency
   conditions, when swap was on. There were no statistically
   significant changes in TPM for the rest of the benchmark matrix.
8. Redis [09] achieved 95% CIs [0.58, 5.94]%, [6.55, 14.58]% and
   [11.47, 19.36]% more total operations per second (OPS),
   respectively, for sequential access, random access and Gaussian
   (distribution) access, when THP=always; 95% CIs [1.27, 3.54]%,
   [10.11, 14.81]% and [8.75, 13.64]% more total OPS, respectively,
   for sequential access, random access and Gaussian access, when
   THP=never.

Read-world applications
=======================
Third-party testimonials
------------------------
Konstantin reported [11]:
   I have Archlinux with 8G RAM + zswap + swap. While developing, I
   have lots of apps opened such as multiple LSP-servers for different
   langs, chats, two browsers, etc... Usually, my system gets quickly
   to a point of SWAP-storms, where I have to kill LSP-servers,
   restart browsers to free memory, etc, otherwise the system lags
   heavily and is barely usable.
   
   1.5 day ago I migrated from 5.11.15 kernel to 5.12 + the LRU
   patchset, and I started up by opening lots of apps to create memory
   pressure, and worked for a day like this. Till now I had not a
   single SWAP-storm, and mind you I got 3.4G in SWAP. I was never
   getting to the point of 3G in SWAP before without a single
   SWAP-storm.

Vaibhav from IBM reported [12]:
   In a synthetic MongoDB Benchmark, seeing an average of ~19%
   throughput improvement on POWER10(Radix MMU + 64K Page Size) with
   MGLRU patches on top of v5.16 kernel for MongoDB + YCSB across
   three different request distributions, namely, Exponential, Uniform
   and Zipfan.

Shuang from U of Rochester reported [13]:
   With the MGLRU, fio achieved 95% CIs [38.95, 40.26]%, [4.12, 6.64]%
   and [9.26, 10.36]% higher throughput, respectively, for random
   access, Zipfian (distribution) access and Gaussian (distribution)
   access, when the average number of jobs per CPU is 1; 95% CIs
   [42.32, 49.15]%, [9.44, 9.89]% and [20.99, 22.86]% higher
   throughput, respectively, for random access, Zipfian access and
   Gaussian access, when the average number of jobs per CPU is 2.

Daniel from Michigan Tech reported [14]:
   With Memcached allocating ~100GB of byte-addressable Optante,
   performance improvement in terms of throughput (measured as queries
   per second) was about 10% for a series of workloads.

Large-scale deployments
-----------------------
The downstream kernels that have been using MGLRU include:
1. Android [15]
2. Arch Linux Zen [16]
3. Chrome OS [17]
4. Liquorix [18]
5. post-factum [19]
6. XanMod [20]

We've rolled out MGLRU to tens of millions of Chrome OS users and
about a million Android users. Google's fleetwide profiling [21] shows
an overall 40% decrease in kswapd CPU usage, in addition to
improvements in other UX metrics, e.g., an 85% decrease in the number
of low-memory kills at the 75th percentile and an 18% decrease in
app launch time at the 50th percentile.

Summery
=======
The facts are:
1. The independent lab results and the real-world applications
   indicate substantial improvements; there are no known regressions.
2. Thrashing prevention, working set estimation and proactive reclaim
   work out of the box; there are no equivalent solutions.
3. There is a lot of new code; no one has demonstrated smaller changes
   with similar effects.

Our options, accordingly, are:
1. Given the amount of evidence, the reported improvements will likely
   materialize for a wide range of workloads.
2. Gauging the interest from the past discussions, the new features
   will likely be put to use for both personal computers and data
   centers.
3. Based on Google's track record, the new code will likely be well
   maintained in the long term. It'd be more difficult if not
   impossible to achieve similar effects with other alternatives.
