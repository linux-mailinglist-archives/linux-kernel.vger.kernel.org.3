I think it might be useful to have a dedicated entry in memory.stat
for proactively reclaimed memory. A case where this would be useful is
tuning and evaluating userspace proactive reclaimers. For instance, if
a userspace agent is asking the kernel to reclaim 100M, but it could
only reclaim 10M, then most probably the proactive reclaimer is not
using a good methodology to figure out how much memory do we need to
reclaim.

IMO this is more useful, and a superset of just reading the last
reclaim request status through memory.reclaim (read stat before and
after).

Additionally, things get complicated if the userspace agent is
multi-threaded. For a cumulative entry in memory.stat, it shouldn't
matter by a lot as we are looking at the total for all threads
cumulatively anyway. If we are only reading the memory reclaimed in
the last request (through memory.reclaim), then we can easily get the
results of a request that happened on a different thread.
