I am not to keen on making sytemd such a proxy. Sounds like something
the kernel could do on its own, better and resulting in an ultimately
simpler system...

If systemd its the proxy this adds in extra raciness. i.e. in a ideal
world, if we have some form of notification fd, then it would be great
if that fd is guaranteed to have POLLIN set and its contents updated
the instant the clone happened. But if we proxy this through
userspace, there's necessarily a latency involved that it it takes
userspace to catch up and effect the POLLIN and updated contents
towards its client apps.

I understand the underlying VM hypervisor APIs currently are designed
to always imply some notification latency. Which sucks, but I think we
should be very careful with replicating this design mistake with any
userspace APIs we add.

i.e. I am pretty sure that even if the underlying VM hypervisor
primitive isn't as good as we wanted, the Linux kernelâ†’userspace API
should be built so that if one day a better VM hypervisor interface
exists it can be plugged behind it without such limitations.

As mentioned earlier, I am not convinced sysctl is the right place for
this. sysctls are understood by most people as being the place for
tweaking kernel settings. This is not a kernel setting, but a
notification concept, and the way Jason defined it there's nothing to
read nor write, which strongly suggests to move it elsewhere, but not
/proc/sys/.

Use /sys/kernel/ or so. Or maybe O_NOTIFICATION_PIPE or whatever, but
/proc/sys/ looks really wrong.

I agree.
