I agree, that there is missing lot of documentation related to Marvell
PCIe controllers, both pci-mvebu.c and pci-aardvark.c. The main problem
now is that it is hard to find information which explain everything...
like mysterious Memory Controller (which is now explained):
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20211003120944.3lmwxylnhlp2kfj7@pali/

> 2) Why do we have these DT entries if they are invalid and useless?

Sorry, I do not know. I was not involved during introducing of DT files
for this platform. I'm just observing how it works...

0xe0000000 is defined in above mentioned "pcie-mem-aperture" DT property
and it is in armada-38x.dtsi DTS file included from armada-385.dtsi:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-38x.dtsi?h=v5.15#n42

In this case pci-mvebu.c split 29MB window into continuous ranges of
power of two (16MB + 8MB + 4MB + 1MB) and then register each range to
mbus slot. Code is in function mvebu_pcie_add_windows():
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/pci/controller/pci-mvebu.c?h=v5.15#n300

So at the end there is continuous space of 29MB PCIe window, just it
"eats" 4 mbus slots.

This function may fail (if there is not enough free mbus slots) and this
patch is propagating that failure back to the caller.

Yes.

I fully agree with you.

But pci-mvebu.c driver and also its DT bindings are written differently.
Changing it probably would not be simple due to backward compatibility
and will take development resources...

For mvebu they are dynamic and kernel assigns them at boot. As my above
printed lspci topology is simple, first bridge has assigned [bus 01-01],
second bridge [bus 02-02] and third bridge [bus 03-03].
