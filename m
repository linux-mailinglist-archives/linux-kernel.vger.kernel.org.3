This patchset is a third one in the series created in the framework of
my Baikal-T1 PCIe/eDMA-related work:

[1: In-progress] clk: Baikal-T1 DDR/PCIe resets and some xGMAC fixes
Link: --submitted--
[2: In-progress] PCI: dwc: Various fixes and cleanups
Link: --submitted--
[3: In-progress] PCI: dwc: Add dma-ranges/YAML-schema/Baikal-T1 support
Link: --you are looking at it--
[4: Stalling]    dmaengine: dw-edma: Add RP/EP local DMA controllers support
Link: --being submitted afterwards--

Note it is very recommended to merge the patchsets in the same order as
they are listed in the set above in order to have them applied smoothly.
Nothing prevents them from being reviewed synchronously though.

This series is about adding new features to the DW PCIe Host/End-point
driver. First of all we start from splitting up the DT-bindings into
common properties schema and generic DW PCIe bindings definition. It's
done to support the generic DW PCIe Host/End-point available platforms
with adding a common YAML-schema to be reused by the platform-specific DW
PCIe bindings. @Rob could you please take a look at that patch? I've got a
problem with dt_bindings_check-ing the schema which is likely caused by
the dt-schema parser misbehaviour. After that we suggest to add a more
verbose link-up log message. Really printing link generation and width
would be much more informative than just "link up". Then a series of
IP-core version-related patches go, like using a native FourCC version
representation, adding the IP-core auto-detection, adding better
structured IP-core version/type interface. After that the
platform-specific host de-initialization method is introduced. A series of
iATU optimizations, cleanups and new features goes afterwards. In
particular we suggest to drop some redundant enumerations, add iATU
regions size detection procedure and then use the regions parameters to
verify the requested by the platform iATU ranges/dma-ranges settings.
After that the dma-ranges property support is added for the DW PCIe Host
controllers. Then a structured set of the DW PCIe RP/EP specific clocks
and resets names/IDs is introduced so to be re-used by the generic and new
platforms. Note it is fully coherent with the DW PCIe controller manuals
(see the patch log for details). Also note the patch doesn't affect the
already available DW PCIe platform-specific code since it would be too
risky for my to do the corresponding conversion, but the maintainers are
welcome to do that. Finally at the series closure we introduce the
Baikal-T1 PCIe interface support, which uses all the recently added
features including the set of the generic clocks and resets names.
