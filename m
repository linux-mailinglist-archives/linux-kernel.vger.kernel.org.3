Maybe there is some misunderstanding.  As you said, demotion is to
free up fast memory.  If pages on fast memory cannot be demoted, but
can still be reclaimed to free some fast memory, it is useful, too.
Certainly, we can also add the support and configure the policy to
only demote, not reclaim, from fast memory in such cases.

In any case, we will not reclaim from slow memory for demotion, if
that is the middle thing you refer to.  This is why nodemask is
proposed for memory.reclaim to support the demotion use case.  With a
separate memory.demote interface and memory tiering topology among
NUMA nodes being well defined by the kernel and shared with the
userspace, we can omit the nodemask argument.
