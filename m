That's logical, as IOMMU is bypassed for DMA with that option.

I still don't get what really triggers it.  This won't happen when you
build modules and load/unload the driver instead of dynamic binding?

And the out-of-range access is puzzling, too.  I guess this comes from
the update of a COEF, i.e. it reads a strange value and tries to
update the value based on it.  The problem is that it's no -1 but some
random value.  This might be tied with the IOMMU error, and it might
reading unexpected address, which would be really bad.

In anyway, we need to track down exactly which access triggers those
errors...

This is intended behavior.  The driver has a static device index that
is incremented at each probe, so that the driver may probe multiple
instances.  It'll be tricky to reset this for dynamic binding,
though.  This problem is not only for HD-audio but for most of other
drivers.  But I leave this as is for now, since the dynamic binding is
rarely used for PCI and other buses, so far.
