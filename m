Since this is apparently a BIOS design choice, it seems wrong to base
the functionality on the Device ID instead of some signal that tells
us what the BIOS is doing.

How do you know this?  You say below that there's an M.2 slot, so
surely the slot could contain a non-storage device?  Couldn't somebody
build a platform with a VMD root port connected to a regular PCIe x4
slot?  Couldn't such a slot support hotplug?

It would be very unusual to hard-code topology knowledge like this
into the kernel, since plug-and-play has always been a major goal of
PCI.

I guess you're saying that 0x1003 is determined by the SoC.  If so, I
think this value should be in your .driver_data (which would mean
converting it from a scalar to a struct, as many other drivers do).
The current code suggests that 0x1003 is the correct value for *all*
VMDs and all configurations.

I don't understand LTR well enough to be convinced that this static
value would be the correct value for all possible hierarchies and
devices that could appear below a VMD root port.  I would love to be
educated about this.
