If it *is* already active, there appears to be a fun chance of crashing if TRACE_INT_MASK is clear and an interrupt happens to fire before anyone has got round to calling perf_aux_output_begin() to make trace_ctrl.handle.rb non-NULL.

Thanks for the further explanation and I think I understand your concerns more clearer.

The trace is not supposed to begin by the firmware at boot time. Due to some hardware restriction, the device cannot trace with non-identical mapping.
So we'd like to use RMR to make the device work when the dma mapping is non-identical. Thus we check here to decide whether to use RMR or not: if the iommu
is not presented or in the passthrough mode, we can use direct DMA by dma_alloc_coherent(); if the iommu is present and the mode is not passthrough, we try
to retrieve RMR or we fail the probe. The firmware is expected to reserve a range of memory and reports it to the driver and is not expected to configure
the trace and do boot time tracing.

> As things stand, RMRs are not yet supported upstream (FYI we're still working on fixing the spec...), so the code above is at best dead, and at worst actively wrong. Furthermore, if the expected usage model *is* that the kernel driver completely resets and reprograms the hardware, then even if there is an RMR for boot-time tracing I would rather expect it to be flagged as remappable, and thus potentially end up as an IOMMU_RESV_DIRECT_RELAXABLE reservation which you wouldn't match anyway.

Yes the firmware is not expected to start the trace. Will change the desired flag to IOMMU_RESV_DIRECT_RELAXABLE and have a test.

> And after all that, if you really do have a genuine need to respect and preserve prior firmware configuration of the device, then I would surely expect to see the driver actually doing exactly that. Presumably: at probe time, look at TRACE_CTRL; if the device is already configured, read out that configuration - especially including TRACE_ADDR_* - and make sure to reuse it. Not go off on a tangent blindly poking into internal IOMMU API abstractions in the vain hope that the first thing you find happens to be sort-of-related to the information that you actually care about.
> 

Yes, we do need RMR to make the device work at situation where the mapping is non-identical.

We're certain that the bios won't start and configure the trace in this device's usage, is it still necessary to make
firmware configure the TRACE_ADDR_* to the device?

As suggested, I think I'll need to modify the RMR codes like

- check TRACE_CTRL, and stop it if it's started. (won't happen but check for sanity)
- if smmu is not presented, use direct DMA
- try to retrieve RMR address with flag IOMMU_RESV_DIRECT_RELAXABLE , if presented set hisi_ptt->has_rmr. in this case we won't use direct DMA
- check if the TRACE_ADDR_* has been configured. if so don't reconfigure it when trace
- if no rmr but smmu works in passthrough mode, use direct DMA
- otherwise fails the probe

If I miss something please point it out.

Thanks,
Yicong
