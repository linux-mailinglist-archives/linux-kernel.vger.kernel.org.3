The original purpose of klp_init_*_early() was to allow calling
klp_free_patch_*() when klp_init_*() fails. The idea was to
initialize all fields properly so that free functions would
do the right thing.

Josh's proposal adds pre-early-init() to allow calling
klp_free_patch_*() already when klp_init_*_early() fails.
The purpose is to make sure that klp_init_*_early()
will actually never fail.

This might make things somehow complicated. Any future change
in klp_init_*_early() might require change in pre-early-init()
to catch eventual problems earlier.

Also I am not sure what to do with the existing checks
in klp_init_patch_early(). I am uneasy with removing them
and hoping that pre-early-init() did the right job.
But if we keep the checks then klp_init_patch_early() then it
might fail and the code will not be ready for this.


My proposal is to use simple trick. klp_free_patch_*() iterate
using the dynamic list (list_for_each_entry) while klp_init_*_early()
iterate using the arrays.

Now, we just need to make sure that klp_init_*_early() will only add
fully initialized structures into the dynamic list. As a result,
klp_free_patch() will see only the fully initialized structures
and could release them. It will not see that not-yet-initialized
structures but it is fine. They are not initialized and they do not
need to be freed.

In fact, I think that klp_init_*_early() functions already do
the right thing. IMHO, if you move the module_get() then you
could safely do:

int klp_enable_patch(struct klp_patch *patch)
{
[...]
	if (!try_module_get(patch->mod)) {
		mutex_unlock(&klp_mutex);
		return -ENODEV;
	}

	ret = klp_init_patch_early(patch);
	if (ret)
		goto err;


Note that it would need to get tested.

Anyway, does it make sense now?

Best Regards,
Petr
