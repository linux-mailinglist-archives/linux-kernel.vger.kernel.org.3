Yeah, I've seen that patch, and many just like that one by the same
author, and I don't think the arguments spelled out there are valid.

Sure, the Kconfig symbol for this driver was bool at the time so the
remove() code could not have received much testing, but the patch
ignores the fact that preventing drivers to be built as modules is
detrimental to multi-platform builds (e.g. Android GKI).

As I mention in passing below, being able to build a driver as a module
is also really useful during development. Not least to be able to test
power-sequencing and making sure that you're not unknowingly relying on
boot firmware to have set things up for you.
