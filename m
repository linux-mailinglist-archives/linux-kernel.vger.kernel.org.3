In concrete terms, "DOE mailbox" refers to a DOE Capability, right?
PCIe devices are allowed to implement several instances of the DOE
Capability, of course.  I'm kind of partial to concreteness because it
makes it easier to map between the code and the spec.

Is there something in this patch related to user-space vs kernel
control of things?  To me this patch looks like "for every DOE
Capability on a device, create an auxiliary device and try to attach
an auxiliary device driver to it."

If part of creating the auxiliary devices is adding things in sysfs, I
think it would be useful to mention that here.

Not sure exactly what this contributes here.  I guess you're saying
you might want user-space access to this, but I don't see anything in
this patch related to that.

IIUC a device can have several DOE Capabilities, and each Capability
can support several protocols.  So I would think the granularity might
be "protocol" rather than "mailbox" (DOE Capability).

But either way this text seems like it would go with a different patch
since this patch has nothing to specify a particular protocol or even
a particular mailbox/DOE Capability.

Here's a case where "iterating over DOE mailboxes found in the device"
is slightly abstract.  The code obviously iterates over DOE
*Capabilities* (PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_DOE), and that's something I can easily
find in the spec.

Knowing that this is a PCIe Capability is useful because it puts it in
the context of other capabilities ("optional things that live in
config space") and the mechanisms for synchronization and user-space
access.

This seems backwards.  What does it mean if the DOE aux dev lifetime
is *greater* than that of the pci_dev?  Surely you can't access a PCI
DOE Capability if the pci_dev is gone?

This doesn't really inspire confidence :)  Playing devil's advocate,
since pdev is an arbitrary device, I would assume the number *is*
large.

pci_msix_vec_count() is apparently sort of discouraged; see
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/PCI/msi-howto.rst?id=v5.16#n179

A DOE Capability may be implemented by any device, e.g., a NIC or
storage HBA, etc.  I'm a little queasy about IRQ alloc happening both
here and in the driver for the device's primary functionality.  Can
you reassure me that this is actually OK and safe?

Sorry if I've asked this before.  If I have, perhaps a comment would
be useful.

But I think you only support MSI-X, since you passed "PCI_IRQ_MSIX", not
"PCI_IRQ_MSI | PCI_IRQ_MSIX" above?

s/IRQ's/IRQs/

"Potentially has other impacts" is too vague, and this doesn't explain
why bus mastering should be enabled here rather than later.  The
device should not issue an MSI-X until DOE Interrupt Enable is set, so
near there seems like a logical place.

This is only used once, above.  Why not just use the string there
directly and skip the #define?  If it's needed elsewhere eventually,
we can add a #define then.
