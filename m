I swear I don't intersect with this stuff that often. Maybe the
reality is I always intersect with this stuff, it just usually works
perfectly :)

Your hint here about xhci_suspend() was helpful. It turns out this is
not called in the freeze path, usb_hcd_pci_pm_ops just calls
check_root_hub_suspended(). The documentation in devices.rst is pretty
clear about this:

```
The ``->freeze`` methods should quiesce the device so that it doesn't
generate IRQs or DMA
```

So I think you're right that the PM layer is doing everything right
(though with a bit of a footgun that if you mess up and generate an
interrupt after freeze it may just be gone forever), and usb core is
at fault here. I've been testing with this patch (mangled in email),
and so far the issue seems to be gone:

@@ -614,10 +622,10 @@ const struct dev_pm_ops usb_hcd_pci_pm_ops = {
        .suspend_noirq  = hcd_pci_suspend_noirq,
        .resume_noirq   = hcd_pci_resume_noirq,
        .resume         = hcd_pci_resume,

-       .freeze_noirq   = check_root_hub_suspended,

+       .thaw           = hcd_pci_resume,
        .poweroff       = hcd_pci_suspend,
        .poweroff_noirq = hcd_pci_suspend_noirq,
        .restore_noirq  = hcd_pci_resume_noirq,


As an aside, one might wonder "why don't we see this everywhere
then?". I think that's because Intel missed a patch enabling runtime
pm on one of these XHCI controllers (8086:51ed). See the quirks below,
that missing 2 on 00:14.0 is XHCI_DEFAULT_PM_RUNTIME_ALLOW:
# dmesg | grep quirks
[    2.804073] xhci_hcd 0000:00:0d.0: hcc params 0x20007fc1 hci
version 0x120 quirks 0x0000000200009810
[    3.108045] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: hcc params 0x20007fc1 hci
version 0x120 quirks 0x0000000000009810

If the XHCI controller were usually in runtime suspend when freeze()
got called, it would be fully quiesced and would not lose its
interrupt. I had noticed this earlier, and it did reduce the repro
rate, but did not reduce it to zero. Now it makes sense why.

I think I have enough info to go make a USB patch now. Thank you for you help!
