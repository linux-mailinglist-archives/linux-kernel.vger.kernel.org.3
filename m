Dear linux-kernel,

I am Barrister Mustafa Ayvaz, a personal attorney to late Mr.=20
Anderson, who died due to Coronavirus Disease, which he=20
contracted during his business trip in China. I want you to be=20
kind and=C2=A0
work with me in securing the money he left behind in the Bank=20
here in Turkey, which is $3,390,000.00 =C2=A0
(Three Million Three Hundred and Ninety Thousand Dollar USD),=20
left by him.

I have searched for the Next Of Kin to my deceased=20
client, but have failed as I do not have his current residence=20
and contact details. As I was searching, I bumped into your=20
profile having the same last name and in the same locality with=20
the Next Of Kin. I decided to contact you and use you as the=20
Bonafide Next Of Kin.

I solicit your consent to produce you as the Next Of Kin to my=20
deceased client since both of you bear the same last name. The=20
funds will then be transferred to you as the beneficiary and=20
shared according to a proposed sharing pattern/ratio of 60:40=20
that is 60% for me and 40% for you. Kindly=20
contact me immediately for more information. 

After which I will send you the details of how the transaction=20
will commence, Contact me back for more information through my=20
email addresses below.

Regards
Mustafa Ayvaz

Thanks
Mustafa Ayvaz
