Ah, thanks for that info! I wasn't sure about that last part.

But we'd still need _something_ in the kernel. All the common software
using TPMs would expect the TPM to be present as /dev/tpmX. So, while it
doesn't have to be a full secure-app driver, we'd need at least some way
to manage a TPM device from user-space (unless we want to tell all
software using TPMs to just support some non-standard thing instead).

For EFI variables, something similar might be possible (i.e. running
efivar operations through a user-space driver), but that will break
pstore in the times it's most usable (i.e. when no user-space exists or
things are sufficiently broken that we can't run things through it any
more).

And then (at least for me) there's the question whether that all seems
sound: Sure, we can maintain some userspace-daemon outside the kernel,
but if it is common enough (i.e. not a one-off used only by some single
vendor and model) and can be easily implemented in the kernel, why not?
Moving it to userspace makes things more complex. You'll need new
userspace APIs (as mentioned above, if you don't want to force all
existing software to adapt to some non-standard thing) and you need to
tell users to install and set up some daemon(s) (making it yet more
difficult to produce a single proper install media that works well on
all the common AArch64 or WoA platforms). All the while you still need
to maintain essentially the same piece of code (whether it is inside or
outside of the kernel), so you don't really win anything there either.

Max
