My apologies for your having been brought into this discussion without
having properly reviewed and summarized the previous thread.   As you
saw there is a long history.

Jarrko, Ahmad,  "Trusted" keys, by definition, are based on the TPM
RNG.  If CAAM trusted key support wants to use kernel RNG by default,
that's fine.  However defining and allowing a boot command line option
to use kernel RNG instead of the TPM RNG, needs to be configurable.

thanks,

Mimi
