Not knowing how to enable a disabled idle state from user-space, and
ensure that it does not race with cpuidle somehow choosing to enter that
state, I have all sorts of concerns about such interactions but can see
how this could be made to work. In fact, I am wondering if we had not
better off work around our broken HW and always advertise that state,
and just let cpuidle pick that "deep" idle state resulting in powering
down secondary core(s). In TF-A we would have to ensure that we save all
of the SPIs affine to that particular core, and probably re-configure
the PPIs and SGIs to be made secure such that TF-A can "trap" them and
wake-up the core that was just powered off.

It sounds like for your suggested approach plus requesting to enter
s2idle, we need to start trapping WFI at ELx into EL3 such that TF-A has
a chance of observing that all CPU cores are powered down and/or idle
and then can engage our power management state machine hardware to clock
gate the system and mux in the out of band interrupts. Unless the boot
CPU's default idle state has to either be modified, or we have to
advertise an additional "deeper" idle state that involves calling into
TF-A with PSCI CPU_SUSPEND, too?

What I really like about our approach other than it has been proven to
work over the past 10 years, is that it fits well with Linux system
suspend path via suspend_ops, with each layer taking care of defining
its points of no return etc. We know how to debug it, and it is not
opportunistic unlike cpuidle, which makes it easier to control. From a
non technical point of view, it is also the devil people are used to,
and no matter how we shape it, there will be resistance to change.

Re-reading the PSCI specification and the SYSTEM_SUSPEND specifically it
does sound like ACPI S2 was taken into account but that lead to
SYSTEM_SUSPEND not allowing to differentiate between these two states on
the premise that "In practice, operating systems use only one suspend to
RAM state, so this is not seen as a limitation". It would have been nice
to leave provision for defining both instead of not.

I am sympathetic to avoid divergence of both interpretation and
implementation of the PSCI specification and its reference
implementation in Linux. So I can see a few paths forward:

- have me try what you suggested, which will take me weeks because I
have a TODO list long like my arm (and my arms are really long),
assuming that this even works for our use cases

- work with you to amend the PSCI specification such that we can
differentiate between an entry into S2 or S3 by defining which state we
want to enter, but I assume we will get lots of resistance here?
