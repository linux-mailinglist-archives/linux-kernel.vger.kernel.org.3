Setting state_saved generally informs pci_pm_suspend_noirq() that the
device has already been handled and it doesn't need to do anything to
it.

But you are right that PTM should be disabled on downstream devices as
well as on the ports that those devices are connected to and it can be
done even if the given device has already been handled, so the
state_saved value is technically irrelevant.

That's why I suggested to check if the power state is between D0 and
D3cold (exclusive) and only disable PTM if that is the case.  It is
pointless to disable PTM for devices in D3cold and it may be harmful
for devices that are left in D0.
