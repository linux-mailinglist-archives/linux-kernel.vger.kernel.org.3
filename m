The Intel driver used to do something similar to bypass the doorbell 
hardware errata for pre Skylake Xeon hardware that wasn't upstream. I'd 
like to get this working for the performance reasons you mentioned. I 
just really need to find some time to test this with the second memory 
window Intel NTB has.
