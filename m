The timeout case I'm not that worried about as it means the device
is out of spec, so whilst it might happen and we don't want to break in that
case it should be uncommon enough that a perf disadvantage doesn't matter.

I missed this particular one originally and someone else pointed it out in
review (can't remember who though). The busy drop is mentioned in the
bit definition. It's in the capability definition.

"DOE Interrupt Status - This bit must be Set when an interrupt is generated
to indicate that the Data Object Ready bit or the DOE Error bit has been Set. or
 that the DOE Busy bit has been Cleared."
(the formatting is in the release spec.. hohum)

Anyhow, upshot is that the status can be set as a result of Busy Bit clearing.
6.30.3 Interrupt Geneeration:  then says that interrupt is generate on a
transition of the logical AND of

1. Vector unmasked
2. DOE interrupt Enable bit is 1
3. Value of the DOE interrupt Status bit is 1.

So if interrupt status bit is set to 1 due to a Busy drop and we then
clear it before Data Object Ready, we'll get 2 interrupts.

There is another vague bit of language that sort of allows other
uses of this interrupt for protocol specific stuff.  Hopefully
no one falls for that, but we should safely handle that case (perf
drop as a result is fine though!)  I can't remember where the exact
language is, but I've had a few 'polite discussions' to persuade
people using it that way would be a very bad idea...

I think in some of these paths we are waiting for Data Object Ready to be
set, the busy drop is effectively acting as a spurious interrupt if we
clear the status before the data object ready event which could be much later
because of Busy can clear really quickly.

Read / Write 1 to clear.  In this case I meant reading it and then clearing it
without looking at the other status bits.

In this case seeing 2 interrupts is highly likely.
We see the Busy drop one and the interrupt handler clears the Interrupt Status
Bit, then data object becomes ready and we go around again.

I probably stuck that comment in the wrong place.  The initial call to clear
the flag before this should be fine (short of the 'spurious' case of people
using the interrupt for protocol specific usage).

This case (which I think is the -EBUSY from pci_doe_send_req() handling)
isn't important because it's trying to paper over a weird condition. We
don't normally expect to get here.

I was concerned with the line just above my comment which may not act as
a gate at all because it's tripped by the the Busy Drop, which may be
well before the data object ready that we are actually waiting for.

Sounds write though without whole code laid out to follow through I'm
not 100% sure yet!

Yeah.  That was a nice suggestion Dan made long ago but it doesn't play well
with the single workqueue.

yup.

Hmm. It puts a requirement on the caller to not queue multiple requests that
might require ordering.  One advantage of flushing the lot was ordering was
unaffected (though any caller that queued multiple items would have to then
requeue multiple items so would have to maintain their own retry buffer).

Sounds good, avoid naming confusion by getting rid of the name :)

If you split to multiple devm_ calls you can not setup a tear down for the
irq if we don't have one. Or, don't use pci_request_irq() but call
devm_request_threaded_irq() directly and let that clean up for you.

No problem. I know how nasty this seemingly simple little bit of code
is, so you have my sympathies :)
