They're trying to design something that can (forever) handle guests that
might not be able to accept memory.  It's based on the idea that
*something* needs to assume control and EFI doesn't have enough
information to assume control.

I wish we didn't need all this complexity, though.

There are three entities that can influence how much memory is accepted:

1. The host
2. The guest firmware
3. The guest kernel (or bootloader or something after the firmware)

This whole thread is about how #2 and #3 talk to each other and make
sure *someone* does it.

I kinda think we should just take the guest firmware out of the picture.
 There are only going to be a few versions of the kernel that can boot
under TDX (or SEV-SNP) and *can't* handle unaccepted memory.  It seems a
bit silly to design this whole interface for a few versions of the OS
that TDX folks tell me can't be used anyway.

I think we should just say if you want to run an OS that doesn't have
unaccepted memory support, you can either:

1. Deal with that at the host level configuration
2. Boot some intermediate thing like a bootloader that does acceptance
   before running the stupid^Wunenlightended OS
3. Live with the 4GB of pre-accepted memory you get with no OS work.

Yeah, this isn't convenient for some hosts.  But, really, this is
preferable to doing an EFI/OS dance until the end of time.
