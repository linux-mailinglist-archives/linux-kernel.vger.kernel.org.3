Indeed, that's not really relevant to this problem.
Sure, if the certificates extension does exist and does not state that
the certificate can be used for code signing then the signature should
be rejected. The same if the signature is malformed and does not provide
enough information to determine which key was used to create it.

The question which key will be checked, though.

There aren't really good tools for working with the kernel signatures
but I can tell what certificate it was signed with jumping throught some
hoops.

What I can't tell without reading the kernel code (different for each
architecture) is what certificates the kernel considers valid for
signing kernels. The kernel surely knows but does not tell.

That is, for example, if I have a known bad kernel I want to be able to
tell if it's loadable without actually loading it.

Thanks
