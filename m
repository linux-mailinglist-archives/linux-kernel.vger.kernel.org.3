After version 10, it would seem pretty clear that we are still very much
committed to and interested in getting that set merged and do it the
most acceptable way possible. Common code with a single user is always a
little bit of a grey area to me as it tends to be developed to cater for
the specific needs of that single user, so the entire common aspect is
debatable. I suppose as long as we have the binding right, the code can
change at will.

Not trying to coerce Bjorn and Lorenzo into accepting these patches if
they don't feel comfortable, but what about getting it included so we
can sort of move on from that topic for a little bit (as we have other
PCIe changes coming in, supporting additional chips etc.) and we work
with Pali on a common solution and ensure it works on our pcie-brcmstb.c
based devices? We are not going to vanish and not come back looking at this.
