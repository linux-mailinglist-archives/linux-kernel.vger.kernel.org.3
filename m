No. It depends on the controller implementation, link-partner
capability and results of the negotiation procedure. In our case by
default the link can't be established higher than Gen.2. In order to
rise it up to maximum possible Gen.3, the link must be re-established
with special flag set in the controller CSR.

The generic bindings can have some more relaxed constraints than older
IP-core released would have. It's absolutely normal to have the
IP-core evolve in time: new standard support is added, new properties,
new clocks sources or reset controls are added, etc. All of that IMO
should be taken into account in the generic DT-schema as it's supposed
to be as generic as possible a priori. It can have some properties
defined, which particular device release can lack of (a brightest
example is the clock/reset-names). While the particular device
DT-schema shall have a more rigor constraints so the corresponding
DT-node would have only the supported properties.

Well, in general not necessarily. New incompatible IP-core might get
released instead by the vendor. Vendor can stop supporting the DW PCIe
controller IP-core, etc.

I don't see much problem in updating the common property when the new
IP-core and its instances are released.
pci-bus.yaml is supposed to contain a generic max PCIe speed defined
by the standards (although currently it doesn't).
snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml will contain the maximum PCIe speed supported
by the known device instances.
These schemas most likely won't be updated synchronously especially
seeing pci-bus.yaml currently defines max PCIe bus speed of Gen.3,
which isn't the maximum the recent standard defines.

If we don't provide the max-link-speed property constraint in the
generic DW PCIe DT-schema, the bindings will be less accurate.
What if the vendor-specific bindings miss the max-link-speed property
constraint while the pci-bus.yaml has greater upper limit than the
IP-core will ever support?..

Anyway I think I've made my point more than clear. I have nothing to
add in this matter. Let's finally finish the discussion. If I wasn't
persuasive enough for you, just explicitly tell me that you'd rather
dropped the patch. So what is your conclusion?
