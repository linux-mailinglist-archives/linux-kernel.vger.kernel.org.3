Not sure yet. I think it would be better to cooperate with AMS like
things which could distinguish scenarios. Such as place
foreground/background processes into different memcgs with different
decay configurations OR dynamic set up the parameters to a specific
memcg.

What I want to achieve is make memory.low be positive correlation with
timing and negative to memory pressure, which means the protected
memcg should lower its protection(via lower memcg.low) for helping
system's memory pressure when it's high. The concept behind is memcg's
fault back of dropped memory is less important than system's latency
on high memory pressure. Please refer to my new version's test data
for more detail.
