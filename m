The problem is that you need all kinds of workarounds so that the
decompressor builds. Just look at the beginning of

arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.h

Even you had to do them:

/* cpu_feature_enabled() cannot be used this early */
#define USE_EARLY_PGTABLE_L5

That thing sprinkled everywhere is not a clean solution.

Yes, those are fine except that not everything that leaks into the
decompressor code through includes is perfectly portable.

> Could you explain what rules are?

Library-like stuff like types.h, linkage.h, etc we could include for now
but including linux/kernel.h which pulls in everything but the kitchen
sink is bad.

So I'd like for the decompressor to be completely separate from kernel
proper because it is a whole different thing and I want for us to be
able to include headers in it without ugly workarounds just so that
kernel proper include changes do not influence the decompressor.

What's wrong with early_accept_memory()?

Yes, put that in the comment pls.

Really?

Please elaborate. I thought memory acceptance is a feature solely for
TDX and SNP guests to use.

So?

I'm not sure what your argument actually is for having yet another
separate header vs putting it in a header which already deals with that
stuff.

You mean, you want for allocate_e820() to call this new function because
both allocate and free?

Might have to explain what you mean here exactly.

From my experience, asking firmware to do stuff for ya is always a risky
thing. I guess such a huge allocation, when it fails, will be caught
early in platform verification so whatever...
