We now have a pretty well established way to transport data to userspace at
really low overhead. If you piggy back on bpf interfaces, they can usually
be pretty unintrusive and low effort as long as you have the right kind of
data aggregated already, which shouldn't be that difficult here.

So, I get that it's not easy. In fact, we don't even yet know how to
properly compare loads across groups of CPUs - simple sums that you're using
break down when there are big gaps in weight numbers across tasks and can
become meaningless in the presence of CPU affinities. They can still work
when the configuration is fairly homogeenous and controlled but the standard
should be far higher for something we bake into the kernel and expose
userland-visible interface for.

I don't think they become necessarily easy. Sure, you can hack up something
which works for some cases by poking into existing code; however, the bar
for acceptance is also way higher for a kernel interface - it should be
generic, consistent with other interfaces (I won't go into cgroup interface
issues here), and work orthogonally with other kernel features (ie. task /
group weights should work in an explainable way). I don't think the proposed
patches are scoring high in those axes.

I'm not against the goal here. Given that cgroups express the logical
structure of applications running on the system, it does make sense to
factor that into scheduling decisions. However, what's proposed seems too
premature and I have a hard time seeing why this level of functionality
would be difficult to be implement from userspace with some additions in
terms of visibility which is really easy to do these days.

Thanks.
