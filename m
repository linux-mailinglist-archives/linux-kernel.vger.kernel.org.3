Yes, not exactly: we put a call to initialize IMA in create_user_ns()
but it's too early to have the mappings, so we can't create the
securityfs entries in that call.  We need the inode to pick up the root
owner from the s_user_ns mappings, so we can't create the dentries for
the IMA securityfs entries until those mappings exist.

I'm assuming that by the time someone tries to mount securityfs inside
the namespace, the mappings are set up, which is why triggering the
notifier to add the files on first mount seems like the best place to
put it.

It's not moving all the setup, just the creation of the securityfs
entries.

Right, in the current scheme of doing things, if they still haven't
written the mappings by the time they do the mount, they're just going
to get nobody/nogroup as uid/gid, but that's their own fault.

We can't create the securityfs entries in fill_super ... I already
tried and the locking just won't allow it.  And if we create them ahead
of time, that create of the entries will trigger fill_super because we
need the superblock to hang the dentries off.
