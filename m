Sorry for being late on reviewing this set. I agree with both of you.

I don't think Bjorn had a chance to have a look at patch (4) now I am
delegating it to him; I am not very keen on adding functionality to PCI
core where it is still a question whether it can be reused by other
drivers (forgive me if I missed some details on previous review
versions).

Is it possible to keep patch (4) brcmstb specific (ie keep the code
out of PCI core for now), we then merge this series and help Pali
implement a generic version based on Rob's suggestion ?

Just let me know please, thanks.

Lorenzo
