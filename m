There are very few scenarios where dropping capabilities in an
unprivileged container makes sense. In a lot of other scenarios it is
just a misunderstanding of the meaning of capabilities and their
relationship to user namespaces. Usually, granting a full set of
capabilities to the payload of an unprivigileged container is the right
thing to do. All things that are properly namespaced will check
capabilities in the relevant user namespace. Those that aren't will
check them against the initial user namespaces.

But I do think the question of whether or not ima should go into
cap_sys_admin is more a question of capability semantics then it is in
how exactly ima is namespaced. We do have agreed before that overloading
cap_sys_admin further isn't ideal. Often we end up rectifying that
mistake later. For example, how we moved stuff like criu, bpf, and perf
to their own capability. Now we're left with stuff like:

static inline bool perfmon_capable(void)
{
	return capable(CAP_PERFMON) || capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN);
}

static inline bool bpf_capable(void)
{
	return capable(CAP_BPF) || capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN);
}

static inline bool checkpoint_restore_ns_capable(struct user_namespace *ns)
{
	return ns_capable(ns, CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE) ||
		ns_capable(ns, CAP_SYS_ADMIN);
}

for the sake of adhering to legacy behavior. I think we can skip over
that mistake and introduce cap_sys_integrity.
