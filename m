I think everyone will be happy with HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE on arm64 as 
long as there is a guarantee that stack traces are really reliable. My 
understanding is that there is still some work to be done on arm64 arch 
side (but I may have misunderstood what Mark R. said elsewhere). And yes, 
then there is a question of objtool. It is one option but not the only 
one. There have been proposals of implementing guarantees on a compiler 
side and leaving objtool for x86_64 only (albeit objtool may bring more 
features to the table... ORC, arch features checking).

Madhavan also mentioned that he enhanced objtool and he planned to submit 
it eventually 
(https://lore.kernel.org/all/1a0e19db-a7f8-4c8e-0163-398fcd364d54@linux.microsoft.com/T/#u), 
so maybe arm64 maintainers could decide on a future direction based on 
that?

Miroslav
