Unfortunately the spec doesn't provide any way of indicating 'who' is using
the DOE. All busy says is that right now the mailbox is not capable of receiving
a new request.  Way back in one of the early posting we considered just dropping
the 'best effort' wait that is there, but I think we concluded it was harmless
and might make things a tiny bit more stable if there was something stale
from before OS load.

Absolutely.  The reality is that DOE isn't suitable for multi actor use.
We need to put in some mediation.  One thing being neglected on my todo
list is that we need a _DSM in ACPI or similar to negotiate access plus
potentially some firmware interfaces to allow the OS to make firmware
mediated calls.  Those firmware interfaces may be at the protocol level
or even further up the stack.

Not sure if we got to it, but this problem was in the slides for
last years Plumbers uconf talk on DOE.

yup, we could drop it, but leave some comment in there that says the spec
suggests checking it.

It didn't.  I decided that it wasn't worth the effort :)

I'm fine with replacing it with comments, or an error print to say that IIRC
the spec says we should wait for it, but reality is that it doesn't work.

Guess I should get on with proposing a _DSM interface to deal with this.
It's a bit messy though as relies on reliable matching of PCI devices against
firmware.  In theory, with the right 'no reenumeration' flags that has a high
chance of working these days but requires some extra language to say that all
bets are off if you reenumerate before figuring out the ACPI to PCI device mapping.
I dropped the ball on getting that element in place.

What fun ;)
