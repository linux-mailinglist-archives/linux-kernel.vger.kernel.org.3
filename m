But these are exactly the kinds of things the secure launch kernel
wants to be made aware of, no? The secure launch kernel could just
MITM the calls that it chooses to allow, and serve other calls itself.

But more fundamentally, I am failing to see the distinction here
between stub code and other kernel code. Is it related to the exact
moment the secure launch event is triggered?

The way I see it, being able to marshall everything that goes on
between the stub and the secure launch kernel allows the latter to
make an informed decision about how the stub has manipulated the
global system state before triggering the secure launch event at
exitbootservices time.

But perhaps my mental model is simply too inaccurate - it would be
helpful to understand what exactly needs to be locked down, and what
aspects of the system state are of interest for the DRTM measurements.
