These are in-kernel implementation, not the ABI.  So we still have
the opportunity to define the ABI now.

If so,

# echo A > memory.reclaim

means

a) "A" bytes memory are freed from the memcg, regardless demoting is
   used or not.

or

b) "A" bytes memory are reclaimed from the memcg, some of them may be
   freed, some of them may be just demoted from DRAM to PMEM.  The total
   number is "A".

For me, a) looks more reasonable.
