I think this new interface better be independent not hierarchical anyway. Especially
when we treat container as lightweight virtual machine.

So you agree it's reasonable to set THP policy for process in container, right?
If so, IMHO, when there are thousands of processes launch and die on the machine,
it will be horrible to do so by calling prctl(), I don't see the reasonability.

For example:
1) userspace set THP policy to always
2) then one unrelated processe A may launch automatic by a script maybe
3) call prctl() to disable THP for A
process A may already use THP with no need.
