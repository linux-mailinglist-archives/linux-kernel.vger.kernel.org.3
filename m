Hi Wojciech,

Please cc me too for anything SCMI related in the future.

Glad to hear that.

Sure.

Indeed and that is intentional. However, lots of concepts in SCMI already aligns
well with ACPI concepts just under different name most of the time.

Correct.

Yes but any reasons why that can't be part of standard power methods.

While that could be true, why do you need to manage the clocks so much outside
the standard power methods in ACPI.

We have discussed in the past, SCMI can be used in ACPI abstracted under the
existing well defined methods(I know you will be shouting not clocks but
we need to know why that can't be done with standards device power/state
methods.

I don't understand what you mean by that.

Not sure if anyone has told so in the public ML. However if you want to
run same platform both in ACPI and DT with same firmware, you can write
ASL to manage clocks via SCMI command so that same firmware can be used.

I may be giving to generic info and may not be addressing your specific
issue, but I need specific info to address that. What have you tried with
ACPI so far, what are the issues you are seeing, ...etc ?
