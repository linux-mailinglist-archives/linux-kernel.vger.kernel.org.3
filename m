Rate and frequency are inverses - in this example, we're seeing 4 events per
second.

The quantiles are for the duration, they give you an idea of the statistical
distribution, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile

In the near future, the quantiles will be removed and replaced with standard
deviation, true and weighted - the quantiles algorithm isn't super accurate, we
can give more accurate numbers with standard deviation.
