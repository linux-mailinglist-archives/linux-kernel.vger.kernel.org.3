I am actually surprised that nobody met the problem yet. There are
"only" 60 attempts to transition the pending tasks.

Well, the problem is mainly with kthreads. User space processes are
migrated also on the kernel boundary. And the fake signal is likely
pretty effective here. And it probably is not that common that
a kthread would occupy a single CPU all the time.

I agree that it might happen theoretically. And it would be great
to be prepared for this. My only concern is the complexity and risk.
We should know that it is worth it.

This limits the range of possible solutions quite a lot. But it is
how it is.

The alternative solution is that the process has to migrate itself
on some safe location.

One crazy idea. It still might be possible to find the called
functions on the stack even when it is not reliable. Then it
might be possible to add another ftrace handler on
these found functions. This other ftrace handler might migrate
the task when it calls this function again.

It assumes that the task will call the same functions again
and again. Also it might require that the tasks checks its
own stack from the ftrace handler. I am not sure if this
is possible.

There might be other variants of this approach.

Best Regards,
Petr
