Changes from V5:[0]

	Rework the patch set to split PCI vs CXL changes
		Also make each change a bit more stand alone for easier review
	Add cxl_cdat structure
	Put CDAT related data structures in cdat.h
	Clarify some device lifetimes with comments
	Incorporate feedback from Jonathan, Bjorn and Dan
		The bigest change is placing the DOE scanning code into the
			pci_doe driver (part of the PCI codre).
		Validate the CDAT when it is read rather than before DSMAS
			parsing
		Do not report DSMAS failure as an error, report a warning and
			keep going.
		Retry reading the table 1 time.
	Update commit messages and this cover letter

NOTE: Should we retry more than 1 time?


CXL drivers need various data which are provided through generic DOE mailboxes
as defined in the PCIe r5.0 ECN.[1]

One such data is the Coherent Device Atribute Table (CDAT).  CDAT data provides
coherent information about the various devices in the system.  It was developed
because systems know longer have apriori knowledge of all coherent devices
within a system.  CDAT describes the coherent characteristics of the
components on the CXL bus separate from system configurations.  The OS can
then, for example, use this information to form correct interleave sets.

To begin reading the CDAT the OS must have support to access the DOE mailboxes
provided by the CXL devices.

The series creates a new PCI DOE auxiliary bus driver.  The CXL devices are
modified to create DOE auxiliary devices which are found and driven by the new
PCI DOE driver.

After the devices are created and the driver attaches, CDAT data is read from
the device and DSMAS information parsed from that CDAT blob for use later.

Because DOE is not specific to DOE but is provided within the PCI spec, the DOE
driver is added to the PCI subsystem.  This is part of the reason the auxiliary
bus architecture was used.  It allows for a clean separation between
subsystems.  In addition, and more importantly, the auxiliary bus architecture
allows for root users to control which DOE mailboxes are controlled by the
kernel and which may be optionally used for direct access by user space.  One
such use case is to allow for CXL Compliance Testing (CXL 2.0 14.16.4
Compliance Mode DOE).  By default the kernel controls this mailbox and would
not allow access to it.  But a root user could detach the driver from this
mailbox and gain direct access to the mailbox on a test system.

sysfs shows this relationship.  Starting with a qemu system with 2 memory
devices mem0 and mem1.

This work was built on Jonathan's V4 series here[2].  The big change is a
conversion to an Auxiliary bus infrastructure which allows the DOE code to be
in a separate driver object which is attached to any DOE devices created by any
device.

This work was tested using qemu with additional patches.[3, 4]
