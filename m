This doesn't work, because you could have memory-A split into memory-A.1
and memory-A.2, and both A.2 and A.1 would ++counter, and wind up with
the same new value "2". The solution is to instead have the hypervisor
pass a unique value and a counter. We currently have a 16 byte unique
value from the hypervisor, which I'm keeping as a kernel space secret
for the RNG; we're waiting on a word-sized monotonic counter interface
from hypervisors in the future. When we have the latter, then we can
start talking about mmapable things. Your use case would probably be
served by exposing that 16-byte unique value (hashed with some constant
for safety I suppose), but I'm hesitant to start going down that route
all at once, especially if we're to have a more useful counter in the
future.
