I'm not really a big fan of doing that unless we follow with the
hardware and Windows folks to double-check that the problem really
shouldn't occur anymore in the BIOS.

Considering the trade-off here: we eliminate a few line additions and
risk making user systems non-bootable. I don't think doing that blindly
is very friendly to our users.
