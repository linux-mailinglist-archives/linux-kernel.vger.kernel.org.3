I need to go look at the various email threads mentioned above before I
continue reading this patch series.

I do have serious concerns with this approach.  I need to investigate
more fully before I can determine whether the concerns are addressed
sufficiently.

To give some background to my longstanding response to similar proposals,
here is my old statement from https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference:

   Overlays
   Mainline Linux Support
   Run time overlay apply and run time overlay remove from user space are
   not supported in the mainline kernel. There   are out of tree patches
   to implement this feature via an overlay manager. The overlay manager
   is used successfully by many users for specific overlays on specific
   boards with specific environments and use cases. However, there are many
   issues with the Linux kernel overlay implementation due to incomplete and
   incorrect code. The overlay manager has not been accepted in mainline due
   to these issues. Once these issues are resolved, it is expected that some
   method of run time overlay apply and overlay removal from user space will
   be supported by the Linux kernel.

   There is a possibility that overlay apply and overlay remove support could
   be phased in slowly, feature by feature, as specific issues are resolved.

Those are my words, not Rob's, but I thought that Rob was somewhat in
agreement with those ideas.  Apparently either I misunderstood his
thoughts, or his thoughts have evolved, since you say that he suggested
overlays in one of the above email threads, and you list him as a
co-developer.

In the next line of the elinux info above, I provide a link to more
detailed information:

   Frank's thoughts on what is needed to complete basic overlay support

The link goes to:

   https://elinux.org/Frank%27s_Evolving_Overlay_Thoughts

That page provides an incomplete list of issues to be resolved, and
a list of "what has been completed".

Please read through the elinux.org page to understand the basis of
my concerns.

If after reading through the related email threads, and this thread,
I agree that overlays are a good approach, I am already aware of areas
that I will have specific comments about on the patches in this thread.
