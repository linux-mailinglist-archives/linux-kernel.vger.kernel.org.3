 No worries, I'm glad we're on the same page now.

 Yes, that's been my concern.

 I haven't run into this limit, but then whoever runs into it is likely 
not going to be someone who's able to come up with a solution like this 
proposed here or possibly understanding it.  Granted, it's only one extra 
range, but still IMHO an unnecessary extra limitation beyond one built 
into hardware.

 Also there are devices out there that have alternative MMIO and port I/O 
BARs available for mapping their CSRs, and while our drivers tend to use 
MMIO in that case those devices still claim a port I/O address range.  If 
you are unlucky they will get an allocation and a device that actually 
needs port I/O to work won't.

 Such unexpected quirks can be very frustrating to IT folk.

 Well, the SPARC port may be able to get away with that, but overall I 
think using PCI bus addresses for port I/O resources is the only sane 
thing to do.  In fact I think for MMIO resources we probably ought to do 
the same, though it may be actually more difficult to implement, because 
it's more likely there are systems out there with multiple per-bus MMIO 
address spaces.

 The reason why I think using bus addresses here is the right thing to do 
is that systems may have multiple decode windows exposed to the CPU(s) 
mapping to the same I/O bus addresses, often for specific purposes.  E.g. 
Alpha has the sparse and the dense address space and some systems (I have 
one with a MIPS CPU) have spaces with different endianness swap policies 
(for matching either bit or byte lanes) wired in the bus logic hardware.  
So the same port I/O location can be mapped at different MMIO addresses 
simultaneously in one system.

 I did some further experimentation with a parallel port option card now, 
and it seems to operate just fine at address 0, likely because plain port 
I/O accessors (`inb', `outb', and friends) have no special intepretation 
for address 0, unlike the iomap handlers:

parport_pc 0000:07:00.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0001)
PCI parallel port detected: 1415:c118, I/O at 0x0(0x8), IRQ 38
parport0: PC-style at 0x0 (0x8), irq 38, using FIFO [PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,EPP,ECP]
lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).

So it seems we're quite inconsistent already.

 Since we need a way to move forward and we have a real issue with PCI BAR 
allocations that cause devices to break I have now posted a fix for RISC-V 
systems only which solves the problem at hand, however wasting one whole 
4KiB I/O address range.  If we ever have a better generic solution, either 
one proposed here or an alternative one, then we can revert the RISC-V 
change.  Cf.
