Add the "PCIe r6.0, sec 5.9" spec reference for the 10ms delay for
transitions to or from D3hot.

s/D3Hot/D3hot/ to match other usage (at least in Linux; the spec does
use "D3Hot")

s/uslseep_range/usleep_range/

Add "()" after function names.

In the subject, "Switch ... to *also* use usleep_range": what does the
"also" mean?  It sounds like it's referring to some other place where
we also use usleep_range()?

I hate the fact that we have to check for those ancient Intel chips at
all, but having to read through the usleep_range() vs msleep() thing
is just painful.  

fsleep() would be much simpler, but I am sympathetic that the fsleep()
range of 10-20ms probably wouldn't get the benefit you want.

I wish Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst included a reason why we
should use msleep() instead of usleep_range() for longer sleeps.  Is
there a reason not to do this:

   static void pci_dev_d3_sleep(struct pci_dev *dev)
   {
        unsigned int delay_ms = max(dev->d3hot_delay, pci_pm_d3hot_delay);
        unsigned int upper;

        if (delay_ms) {
                /* 20% upper bound, 1ms minimum */
                upper = max(DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(delay_ms, 5), 1U)
                usleep_range(delay_ms * USEC_PER_MSEC,
                             (delay_ms + upper) * USEC_PER_MSEC);
        }
   }

Since the Intel quirk is for 120ms, a 20% upper bound would make the
range 120-144ms.  Would that be a problem?  Those chips are ancient;
the list is untouched since it was added in 2006.  The point of
usleep_range() is to allow the scheduler to coalesce the wakeup with
other events, so it seems unlikely we'd ever wait the whole 144ms.  I
vote for optimizing the readability over sleep/resume time for
already-broken chips.
