 Sure, but I have yet to see a system where it is the case.

 Also in principle peer PCI buses could have their own port I/O address 
spaces each mapped via distinct MMIO windows in the CPU address space, but 
I haven't heard of such a system.  That of course doesn't mean there's no 
such system in existence.

 AFAICT the RISC-V port uses definitions from include/asm-generic/io.h.  
Palmer, did I get this right?
