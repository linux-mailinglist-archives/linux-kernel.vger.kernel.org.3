Hi Coli,

Just checking in, its been a while and I didn't see any more discussion on 
the topic:

This would benefit users with older RAID controllers using RAID-5/6 that 
don't set io_opt.

Even new new RAID controlers that _do_ provide `io_opt` still do _not_ 
indicate partial_stripes_expensive (which is an mdraid feature, but Martin 
please correct me if I'm wrong here).  Thus, all hardware RAID-5/6 users 
could benefit by manually flagging partial_stripes_expensive to get burst 
writes out of bcache that fit their stride width.

This patch probably needs rebased and documentation updated about io_opt, 
but here is the original patch with documentation for your reference:
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/6/22/298

What do you think?

-Eric
