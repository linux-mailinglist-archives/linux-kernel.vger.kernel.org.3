Remove them. Then remove the #ifdef __arch64__ too, since the code under 
there is doing a passable impression of generic DMA API usage, as long 
as one ignores the bigger picture.

arm64 already uses dma-direct. To say you don't care about the arm64 
code when asking how to deal with ARM having now been converted to use 
dma-direct as well is supremely missing the point.
