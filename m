Shortly speaking: explicitly none of them are broken, but implicitly most
of them are broken.)

As I said the generic DT-bindings permit having the dma-ranges
property specified for the PCIe RCs:
Link: https://github.com/robherring/dt-schema/blob/master/schemas/pci/pci-bus.yaml#L47

So all the PCIe RC bindings can be equipped with the dma-ranges
property. At least dtschema check tool won't print any error if the
property is specified for any of the currently available PCIe RC
device including DW PCIe RC. But if the dma-ranges aren't supported by
the driver having it specified won't give any expected effect. In case
of the DW PCIe RC device setting the dma-ranges property up won't
change anything because without this patch the dma-ranges won't be
accordingly translated to the inbound iATU settings.

The problem described above is indeed specific to the Baikal-T1
platform.

Basically it can be tested out on any platform, not only on ours. You
don't even need to have the problem described above. All you need is a
DW PCIe RC-device with the inbound iATU windows support, this patch
and a dts file with the dma-ranges specified for the corresponding DT
device node.

Secondly even if you do move this patch to that series it likely won't
be tested by anyone but me, which I and our customer have already done
many times here. By postponing the patch merge in you'll just postpone
the feature being utilized by the rest of the kernel users and nothing
else. I am sure it's working at least in our case. Let's add it to the
kernel on this cycle so in case of unexpected problems they could be
fixed in the next rc-stages.
