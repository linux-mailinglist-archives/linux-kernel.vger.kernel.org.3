When trying to load modules built for RISC-V which include assembly files
the kernel loader errors with "unexpected relocation type 'R_RISCV_ALIGN'"
due to R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations being generated by the assembler.

The R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations can be removed at the expense of code space
by adding -mno-relax to gcc and as.  In commit 7a8e7da42250138
("RISC-V: Fixes to module loading") -mno-relax is added to the build
variable KBUILD_CFLAGS_MODULE. See [1] for more info.

The issue is that when kbuild builds a .S file, it invokes gcc with
the -mno-relax flag, but this is not being passed through to the
assembler. Adding -Wa,-mno-relax to KBUILD_AFLAGS_MODULE ensures that
the assembler is invoked correctly. This may have now been fixed in
gcc[2] and this addition should not stop newer gcc and as from working.
