Ah.. I think I'd been thinking it was scoped to a single parent rather than
all devices in the system.  Definitely rather horrible.
Can we do something with device_for_each_child() instead with a match on
bus type to check its an auxilliary bus device then I guess a name based
check on whether that is a doe.  etc.
