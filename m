Ah yes, I figure it out from the comments but then confused myself when 
writing the email.

Hmm how? Before run_job() the jobs are not runnable, sitting in the 
scheduler queues, right?

Right, and you have one GPU with four rings, which means you expose 12 
priority levels to userspace, did I get that right?

If so how do you convey in the ABI that not all there priority levels 
are equal? Like userspace can submit at prio 4 and expect prio 3 to 
preempt, as would prio 2 preempt prio 3. While actual behaviour will not 
match - 3 will not preempt 4.

Also, does your userspace stack (EGL/Vulkan) use the priorities? I had a 
quick peek in Mesa but did not spot it - although I am not really at 
home there yet so maybe I missed it.

Is that one or multiple threads submitting jobs?

On the direct reclaim path when invoked from the submit ioctl? In i915 
we only shrink idle objects on direct reclaim and leave active ones for 
the swapper. It depends on how your locking looks like whether you could 
do them, whether there would be coupling of locks and fs-reclaim context.
