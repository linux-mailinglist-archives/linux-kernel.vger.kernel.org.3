IIUC pirq_enable_irq() is only used for non-ACPI, non-DT, non-Xen,
non-Intel MID systems, so this is a real legacy path.

I don't think it's really worth cluttering an error case in a path
that should be rarely used in the first place.

Are you seeing a problem where you're getting the wrong error message
today?  Can we just fix that problem instead so no kernel parameter is
needed in the first place?
