Indeed it's clearly referring to either direction of *the change*, i.e. 
from edge to level and from level to edge.

I think the important concept to grasp here is that what we describe in 
DT is not properties of the device in isolation, but properties of its 
integration into the system as a whole. Consider the "reg" property, 
which in 99% of cases has nothing to do with the actual device it 
belongs to, but is instead describing a property of the interconnect, 
namely how its address map decodes to a particular interface, to which 
the given device happens to be attached.

At the HDL level, the device block may very well have an output signal 
which idles at logic-high, and pulses low to indicate an event, however 
it only becomes an *interrupt* if it is wired up to an interrupt 
controller; on its own it's just some output signal. What the DT 
interrupt specifier describes is that wiring, *from the interrupt 
controller's point of view*. If a pulsed signal is fed into an Arm GIC 
SPI input then as an interrupt it *is* IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING, because 
that's how the GIC hardware will treat it. The integration as a whole 
takes care of the details and makes that happen, so what the logic 
levels at some arbitrary HDL boundary in the middle might be is simply 
not meaningful.

Thanks,
Robin.
