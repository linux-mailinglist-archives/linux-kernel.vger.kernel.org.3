That's I only pushed it out Friday night (US/Eastern), and Stephen
Rothwell creates new linux-next release based on snapshots taken
Monday through Friday in the Morning (AU/Canberra time).

Things have been crazy busy, so a last set of ext4 backports only
happened Friday starting around 10pm localtime.  (Yes, I have no
life.)

I did add a Fixes tag in what is in the ext4 tree.  I don't always
mention when I've rewritten since that requries manual editing of the
"b4 ty" generated acknowledgement.

In the ideal world when I rewrite the one-line snapshot, at the *very*
least it should show up in the Applied/thanks.  Maybe something like
this:

[1/1] ext4: change variable "count" to signed integer
      commit: fefb759df063599ad483422eb07ef8e14c612cc2
      rewritten summary: ext4: make variable "count" signed

... and if the commit description is rewritten, maybe the "b4 ty"
e-mail should mention it.  (Very often I end up rewriting commit
descriptions, especially when the original poster's first language is
not English.)

For the record, this is what is in the ext4 tree that I plan to push
to Linus is:

commit fefb759df063599ad483422eb07ef8e14c612cc2
Author: Ding Xiang <dingxiang@cmss.chinamobile.com>
Date:   Mon May 30 18:00:47 2022 +0800

    ext4: make variable "count" signed
    
    Since dx_make_map() may return -EFSCORRUPTED now, so change "count" to
    be a signed integer so we can correct check for an error code returned
    by dx_make_map().
