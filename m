Hi Bjorn,
I am not sure how to do it properly, especially for the 2.1.0 IP that
IPQ8064 uses
and that is already filled with tweaks to get it properly working.

As far as I can tell, the reason why it works for all of the others is that they
dont use a PHY driver at all (2.1.0 in IPQ8064 and 2.4.0 in IPQ4019),
1.1.0 in APQ8084 appears to be unused completely as its compatible is not
used in any of the DTS-es.
2.3.2 in MSM8996 and MSM8998 also use QMP, so I am not sure why these work.

It has been broken since then, it worked on 5.10 when I started poking around
IPQ8074 and after backporting the 5.11 commits to get the Gen3 port working
it stopped working, and I traced that down to hanging after a DBI write.

This appears to be QCA-s attempt to always power on the PHY before the init:

This patch applies to 5.19 as well, though I will send a v4 with the
updated description.
Like, I said, I am not sure how to move DBI accesses in other IP-s
without breaking them.
