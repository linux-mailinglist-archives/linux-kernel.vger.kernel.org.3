Thanks, Krzysztof, all great advice.

Not having looked at the driver at all, and because I'm not at all
expert in native drivers like this, also reuse as much of the
structure of other drivers as possible, especially the siblings in
drivers/pci/controller/dwc/.  That means similar structure, similar
variable names, similar function names, etc.  This makes it easier for
people to compare with other drivers to see which are affected by
future bug fixes.
