And that's exactly my point. Yes, it is always possible to build a UP
system. But is it worth *maintaining* a configuration option for this?
I seriously doubt it.

My advise is to stick to SMP only for now (it will run just fine on a
UP machine), and only if upstream users find it completely
unacceptable should a !SMP option be introduced, or make it a runtime
decision (32bit ARM has had SMP_ON_UP support for a long time).
