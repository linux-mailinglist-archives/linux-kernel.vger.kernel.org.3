I have to say this is still very confusing to me. The low limit is a
protection against external (e.g. global) memory pressure. Decreasing
the protection based on the external pressure sounds like it goes right
against the purpose of the knob. I can see reasons to update protection
based on refaults or other metrics from the userspace but I still do not
see how this is a good auto-magic tuning done by the kernel.

Can you give some specific examples?

Please note that sending new RFCs will just make the discussion spread
over several email threads which will get increasingly hard to follow.
So do not post another version until it is really clear what is the
actual semantic you are proposing.
