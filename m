The affinity setting should not happen since DWC MSI controller doesn't support
setting IRQ affinity (hierarchial IRQ domain). In the migrate_one_irq()
function, there is a check for the existence of the irq_set_affinity()
callback, but the DWC MSI controller return -EINVAL in the callback. So this
is the reason the migration was still atempted?

A quick check would be to test this suspend/resume with GIC ITS for MSI since
it supports settings IRQ affinity and resides in a separate domain.
Chaitanya, can you try that?

Wake up should be handled by a dedicated side-band GPIO or in-band PME message.

But I still wonder how the link stays in L1/L1ss when the clocks are disabled
and PHY is powered down. Maybe the link or phy is powered by a separate power
domain like MX that keeps the link active?
