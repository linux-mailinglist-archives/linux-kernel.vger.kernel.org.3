Good point.

I actually know about one case where this might be very useful.

There is the problem with kobject lifetime and module removal.
module is removed after mod->exit() callback finishes. But some
kobject release() callbacks might be delayed, especillay when
CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE is enabled.

I have proposed there a solution where kobject_add_internal() takes reference
on the module. It would make sure that the module will stay in the
memory until the release callbacks is called, see
https://lore.kernel.org/all/Ya84O2%2FnYCyNb%2Ffp@alley/

But kobject_add_internal() is not the right place. The reference on
the module should be taken already in kobject_init() because the
release callbacks might be used after this point.

Best Regards,
Petr
