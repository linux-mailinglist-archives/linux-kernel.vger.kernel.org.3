"RB" isn't mentioned in pcie-brcmstb.c.  What's the connection to it?
Is it just an example, and the actual name doesn't matter?

I guess this is all functionality that depends on new properties in
the DT?  Prior to this patch, pcie-brcmstb.c didn't do anything at all
with regulators, although brcm,stb-pcie.yaml does mention
"vpcie3v3-supply" in an example.

I think these forward declarations are unnecessary.  I can remove them
if you agree.

I guess you're using the pci_bus dev->driver_data.  I don't know of
other users of it, but there's really no ownership model for it.  If
it's non-NULL here, it means somebody else, e.g., the PCI core, is
already using it, and when you overwrite it below, you will break that
other user.

I think you should complain and return instead of breaking the other
user.  That will mean the regulator won't get enabled and your
endpoint won't work, but I think that's a better way to fail than by
overwriting somebody else's pointer, which may lead to memory
corruption that's very hard to debug.
