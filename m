Adding support for the new IMA signature format to fsverity_verify_signature()
*might* make sense.  (When I added this code, my understanding was that it was
just verifying signatures the way the kernel usually verifies signatures.  I
don't think I realized there was a more direct, PKCS#7-less way to do it and
that IMA used that way.)  However, it would be better to use this as an
opportunity to move people off of the built-in signatures entirely, either by
switching to a full userspace solution or by switching to IMA.

Part of the problem with IMA is that no one wants to use it because it has
terrible documentation.  It sounds like it's really complicated, and tied to
specific TCG standards and to TPMs.  I think if it was documented better, people
would find it more attractive and wouldn't be trying to avoid it at all costs.
