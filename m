Thanks, Stefan, for the suggestions.  I tried to minimize the changes
as much as possible.  Based on another thread, the documentation should
be updated, but I'm not going to be presumptuous and make those
changes.  Eric, should I drop this patch and let you update the fs-
verity documentation as you want?
