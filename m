I think I now understand what you mean. I somehow remembered that some
architectures set a PTE dirty when marking it writable, but I guess this
is not true -- and setting it writable will keep it !dirty until really
accessed (either by the HW or by a fault). [I'll do some more digging
just to confirm]

With that in mind, your patch makes sense, and I guess you'd want that
as patch #1, because otherwise I fail to see how current patch #1 would
even succeed in reaching the "pte_mkdirty" call -- if !pte_dirty()
protects the code from running.

I understand the reasoning for anonymous memory, but not for page cache
pages. And for anonymous memory I think there are still cases where we
don't want to do that (swapcache and MADV_FREE comes to mind) -- and
IMHO some of the scenarios where we have clean anonymous memory at all,
we just don't care about optimizing for setting the dirty bit faster on
x86 ;) .

So my gut feeling is to keep it as simple as possible. To me, it
translates to setting the dirty bit only if we have clear indication
that write access is likely next.

Thanks Nadav for refreshing my memory :) !
