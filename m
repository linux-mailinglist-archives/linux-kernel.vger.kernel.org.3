The difference here is that some limits are most likely set once and
never adjusted, e.g. memory.max or memory.low.
I do definitely remember some issues around memory.high, but as I recall,
we've fixed them on the kernel side. We've even had a private memory.high.tmp
interface with a value and a timeout, which later was replaced with
a memory.reclaim interface similar to what we discuss here.
But with memory.high we set the limit first, so if a user tries to reclaim
a lot of hot memory, it will soon put all processes in the cgroup into
the sleep/direct reclaim. So it's not expected to block for too long.

In general it all comes to the question how hard the kernel should try to
reclaim the memory before giving up. The userspace might have different
needs in different cases. But if the interface is defined very vaguely like
it tries for an undefined amount of time and then gives up, it's hard to
use it in a predictive manner.

Thanks!
