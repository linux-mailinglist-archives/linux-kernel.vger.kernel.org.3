Yes rely on the firmware preferably auto discover, if that is not an option,
how about query. It seem to be working in your case.

It may not be too bad compared to putting loads of firmware details
in the DT. What happens if you get a firmware upgrade with changed
number of firmware entities or even if the names are changed.

Are these name user ABI in a way that they won't be changed ? Generally
these entities tend to use UUID and the name you have might get changed.

I would ideally prefer even the name to be supplied from the userspace.
In this particular case, make this a driver and have the name as the
parameter. If the secure side services are used by some non-secure
applications, then you will need to have a user-interface which means
you can get the named from the userspace. No need to change the driver
in either case. Please let me know if I am missing anything to consider
here.

Not sure if I understand the comparison here. But if there is some device
that is access restricted but needs to be accessed and has mechanism to
access, then you would model it as device in DT.

But the one $subject is addressing looks pure software and doesn't make
sense to model in DT IMO.

You did say you use some query API to check this. I haven't seen the driver,
so relying on what you said earlier.
