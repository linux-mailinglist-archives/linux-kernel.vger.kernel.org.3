Indeed.

The port in this case, that is marked as external facing, is the PCIe
root port that the add-in-card is connected to and that is known for the
firmware in advance.

Is the problem that we are here trying to solve the fact that user can
disable the IOMMU protection from the command line? Or the fact that the
firmware might not declare all the ports properly so we may end up in a
situation that some of the ports do not get the full IOMMU protection.

These are Microsoft requirements for the OEMs in order to pass their
firmware test suite so here I would not expect to have issues. Otherwise
they simply cannot ship the thing with Windows installed.

IMHO we should just trust the firmare provided information here
(otherwise we are screwed anyway as there is no way to tell if the
devices connected prior the OS can still do DMA), and use the external
facing port indicator to idenfity the ports that need DMA protection.
