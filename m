Actually, I think my understanding is wrong.  Even though the PCI core
hasn't enumerated the Root Port as a pci_dev, brcm_pcie_setup() knows
about it and should be able to look up the regulators and turn them
on.

Can you dig up the previous discussion about why the regulators need
to be under the Root Port and why they can't be turned on before
calling pci_host_probe()?
