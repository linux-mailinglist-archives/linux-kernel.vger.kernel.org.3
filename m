v3 -- Replaced "refusal mode" commit with one that gates config
      space accesses based on link status (Bjorn)
   -- Restrict the brcm_pcie_start_link() code to only those things
      related to link-up and put the rest in brcm_pcie_setup()
   -- Added commit to change map functions to end with 'map_bus' (Bjorn)
   -- s/0x060400/PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI_NORMAL/ (Pali)
   -- Limit config space accesess to 4k window.
   -- Remove wording in a commit message that said the regulators
      could be endpoint power supplies

V2  -- As v1 included the minimal code to fix a regression.  v2 does
       the same but adds some improvements suggested by Bjorn.
    -- In the unlikely but possible case that some other driver
       starts using the port driver's dev_data field, do not overwrite
       it but issue an error and return.
    -- Functions probe() and resume() do similar operations but
       did them in a different order; make this order consistent
       for both.
    -- New commit to remove forward declarations.
    -- New commit for only the PCIe config-space access "refusal mode".
    -- brcm_pcie_linkup renamed to brcm_pcie_start_link
    -- Add '_noirq' to the brcm_pcie_{suspend,resume} function names
       to match the dev_pm_ops names.
    -- Changes to commit messages:
           o Explain why we are splitting a function in two parts.
           o s/RB/Root Port/

    NOTE for Bjorn: The two commits "add mechanism .." and "add control ..."
        would probably be more clear if they were squashed.  They are kept
        separate as the first one's code may someday be moved under the Port
        driver.  As such, there's some churn.

    NOTE for Bjorn: There is no hurry on Broadcom's side wrt which
        release cycle/phase this patchset is applied.  It goes in
        when you think it is ready.

V1 -- Resubmission of patchset after original was reverted for a
    regression.

    A submission [1] was made to enable a PCIe root port to turn on
    regulators for downstream devices.  It was accepted.  Months later, a
    regression was discovered on an RPi CM4 [2].  The patchset was reverted
    [3] as the fix came too late in the release cycle.  The regression in
    question is triggered only when the PCIe RC DT node has no root port
    subnode, which is a perfectly reasonsable configuration.

    The original commits are now being resubmitted with some modifications
    to fix the regression.  The modifcations on the original commits are
    described below (the SHA is that of the original commit):

        regression that was corrected by a subsequent commit in the same
