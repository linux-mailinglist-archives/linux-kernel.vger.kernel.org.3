Yes, I had a quick look at the code and went to the algorithm description.

Still digesting ...

+10% perf improvements sounds great. What about the temperature
mitigation (temp avg + stddev) ?

I'm worried about the complexity of the algorithm and the overhead implied.

The k_* factors are tied with the system and the thermal setup (fan,
heatsink, processor, opp, ...). So IIUC when the factors are found, they
should not change and could be part of the system setup.

Would the algorithm fit better in a separate userspace kernel tooling?
So we can run it once and find the k_* for a board.

Additionally, the values can be stored in the Documentation for
different board and a documentation on how to use the tool.

Then up to the SoC vendor to setup the k_* in sysfs, so no need to
change any interface.

Yes,
