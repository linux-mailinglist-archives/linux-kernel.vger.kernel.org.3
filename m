Nah, just a separate, normal partition.

That could be the case. See, this box is simply a test laptop where I
boot kernels all the time and userspace doesn't get updated, pretty
much. So if old tools massage the superblock and new kernels then touch
it again, that could mean there's some discrepancy there... but what do
I know - I have not clue about fs.

In any case, 5.18-rc7+ didn't have those earlier messages but simply:

EXT4-fs (sda5): warning: mounting fs with errors, running e2fsck is recommended
EXT4-fs (sda5): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Quota mode: disabled.

but I haven't run any fsck yet. Since this is a test box, it doesn't
matter a whole lot, though.

Thx.
