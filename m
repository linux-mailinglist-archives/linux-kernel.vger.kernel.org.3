OK, I think I'm starting to see, but I'm still missing some things.

67211aadcb4b ("PCI: brcmstb: Add mechanism to turn on subdev
regulators") added pci_subdev_regulators_add_bus() as an .add_bus()
method.  This is called by pci_alloc_child_bus(), and if the DT
describes any regulators for the bridge leading to the new child bus,
we turn them on.

Then 93e41f3fca3d ("PCI: brcmstb: Add control of subdevice voltage
regulators") added brcm_pcie_add_bus() and made *it* the .add_bus()
method.  It turns on the regulators and brings the link up, but it
skips both if there's no DT node for the bridge to the new bus.

I guess RPi4 CM has no DT node to describe regulators, so we skip both
turning them on *and* bringing the link up?

But above you say it's the *endpoint* node that doesn't exist.  The
existing code looks like it's checking for the *bridge* node
(bus->dev->of_node).  We haven't even enumerated the devices on the
child bus, so we don't know about them at this point.

What happens if there is a DT node for the bridge, but it doesn't
describe any regulators?  I assume regulator_bulk_get() will fail, and
it looks like that might still keep us from bringing the link up?

I would think that lack of regulator description in the DT would mean
that any regulators are always on and the OS doesn't need to do
anything.

I'm confused.  Why can't we tell by looking at pcie-brcmstb.c?  All I
know is what's in pcie-brcmstb.c; I have no idea which things apply to
which products.

The only calls to regulator_bulk_disable() are in
pci_subdev_regulators_remove_bus(), brcm_pcie_suspend(), and
brcm_pcie_resume().  I don't think the fact that enumeration didn't
find any devices necessarily leads to any of those.  What am I
missing?  (This is really a tangent that isn't critical for fixing the
regression.)

I don't mean that you should use ACPI, only that ACPI platforms can do
this sort of power control using the existing PCI core infrastructure,
and maybe there's a way for OF/DT platforms to hook into that same
infrastructure to minimize the driver-specific work.  E.g., maybe
there's a way to extend platform_pci_set_power_state() and similar to
manage these regulators.

I don't think having an endpoint driver turn on power to its device is
the right goal.  As you said, if the power is off, we don't know
whether there's an endpoint or what it is, so the driver isn't in the
picture (I know sometimes endpoints are described in DT, and that
might be needed for non-discoverable properties, but I don't think
it's a good way to *enumerate* the device).

I don't know much about ACPI power management, but I kind of think it
turns on power to *everything* initially so we can enumerate all the
devices (Rafael or others, please correct me!)  After enumeration, we
can turn off devices we don't need, and the power management framework 
already supports turning devices on again when we use them.

If it's as easy as dropping a needlessly platform-dependent check, we
should absolutely do it.  Are you saying the patch would just become
this?

Of course.  That's why I labeled these "tangents"; they're just things
for future work that I noticed and didn't want to forget.
