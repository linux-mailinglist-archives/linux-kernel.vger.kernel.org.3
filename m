Hm, I only have the PCIe r4.0 Base Spec available and the section
number is 7.8.11 there.  Is 7.5.3.11 really correct for the r5.0 spec?

There is a similar issue on resume.  The PCI core writes to the
Slot Control register in...

  pci_pm_resume_noirq()
    pci_pm_default_resume_early()
      pci_restore_state()
        pci_restore_pcie_state()

...and to ensure that the proper Command Completed dance is performed,
we do this in pciehp_resume_noirq() and pciehp_runtime_resume():

	/* pci_restore_state() just wrote to the Slot Control register */
	ctrl->cmd_started = jiffies;
	ctrl->cmd_busy = true;

That was introduced by 469e764c4a3c.

I'd prefer that we do the same in pciehp_probe() (or pcie_init())
if we come to the conlusion that we want to continue disabling HPIE
and CCIE in get_port_device_capability().  It's a much simpler and
smaller solution than the one proposed in the present patch.

I guess an argument could be made that even though CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_PCIE
is enabled, pciehp may fail to probe, e.g. because the call to kzalloc()
in pcie_init() returns NULL due to insufficient memory.  Then the interrupt
would remain enabled if the BIOS neglected to disable it.  That could be
accounted for by rearranging pciehp such that the interrupt is disabled
first thing on probe.  Of course that approach doesn't solve the problem
if CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_PCIE is disabled and we'd still have to disable
the interrupt in get_port_device_capability() in that case.

I think it generally makes sense to assume the worst and compensate for
broken BIOSes.

Hotplug and PME share the same MSI or MSI-X vector per section 6.7.3.4
of the PCIe Base Spec, so enabled but unhandled hotplug interrupts will
cause the PME interrupt handler to run.  That's probably not fatal,
but still undesirable.

Thanks,

Lukas
