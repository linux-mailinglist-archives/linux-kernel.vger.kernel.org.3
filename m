If you jump back into the system firmware, sure.

But the point I was trying to make is that you can replace that with
your own minimal implementation of EFI that just exposes a memory map
and some protocols and nothing else, and then the secure launch kernel
would be entirely in charge of the execution environment.

In fact, I have been experimenting with running the EFI stub
unprivileged on arm64, which would give the secure launch kernel very
tight control over what goes on between the stub entry and
ExitBootServices(). I would be happy to entertain patches that remove
any issues that complicate running the stub unprivileged for x86 or
other architectures.
