I totally agree, I'm not worried about EFI variables here, I don't know
why that came up.

So what does userspace really need here?  Just the ability to find if
the platform has blobs that it cares about, and how to read/write them.

I see different platform patches trying to stick these blobs in
different locations and ways to access (securityfs, sysfs, char device
node), which seems crazy to me.  Why can't we at least pick one way to
access these to start with, and then have the filesystem layout be
platform-specific as needed, which will give the correct hints to
userspace as to what it needs to do here?

thanks,
