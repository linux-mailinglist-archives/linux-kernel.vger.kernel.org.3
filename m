Subject: [PATCH v4 0/4] mm/page_owner: Extend page_owner to show memcg information

 v4:
  - Take rcu_read_lock() when memcg is being accessed as suggested by
    Michal.
  - Make print_page_owner_memcg() return the new offset into the buffer
    and put CONFIG_MEMCG block inside as suggested by Mike.
  - Directly use TASK_COMM_LEN as length of name buffer as suggested by
    Roman.

 v3:
  - Add unlikely() to patch 1 and clarify that -1 will not be returned.
  - Use a helper function to print out memcg information in patch 3.
  - Add a new patch 4 to store task command name in page_owner
    structure.

 v2:
  - Remove the SNPRINTF() macro as suggested by Ira and use scnprintf()
    instead to remove some buffer overrun checks.
  - Add a patch to optimize vscnprintf with a size parameter of 0.

While debugging the constant increase in percpu memory consumption on
a system that spawned large number of containers, it was found that a
lot of offline mem_cgroup structures remained in place without being
freed. Further investigation indicated that those mem_cgroup structures
were pinned by some pages.

In order to find out what those pages are, the existing page_owner
debugging tool is extended to show memory cgroup information and whether
those memcgs are offline or not. With the enhanced page_owner tool,
the following is a typical page that pinned the mem_cgroup structure
in my test case:

Page allocated via order 0, mask 0x1100cca(GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE), pid 162970 (podman), ts 1097761405537 ns, free_ts 1097760838089 ns

So the page was not freed because it was part of a shmem segment. That
is useful information that can help users to diagnose similar problems.

With cgroup v1, /proc/cgroups can be read to find out the total number
of memory cgroups (online + offline). With cgroup v2, the cgroup.stat of
the root cgroup can be read to find the number of dying cgroups (most
likely pinned by dying memcgs).

The page_owner feature is not supposed to be enabled for production
system due to its memory overhead. However, if it is suspected that
dying memcgs are increasing over time, a test environment with page_owner
enabled can then be set up with appropriate workload for further analysis
on what may be causing the increasing number of dying memcgs.

Waiman Long (4):
  lib/vsprintf: Avoid redundant work with 0 size
  mm/page_owner: Use scnprintf() to avoid excessive buffer overrun check
  mm/page_owner: Print memcg information
  mm/page_owner: Record task command name
