Well, what could presumably happen is that if someone dirtied superblock
(say while processing orphan list), then flush worker could come just after
we set s_last_orphan and before we update the checksum. Now I don't think
we currently dirty superblock during orphan cleanup but it is certainly
slightly fragile to rely on this.
