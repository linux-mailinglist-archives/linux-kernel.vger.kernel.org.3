Thank you for the suggestions. I will rephrase the commit message
accordingly like this:


PCI: Allow PASID only when ACS enforced on upstreaming path

The PCIe fabric routes TLPs based on memory addresses for all PCIe Memory
Requests regardless of whether TLPs have PASID prefixes. This is stated in
section "2.2.10.2 End-End TLP Prefix Processing" of the specification:

   The presence of an End-End TLP Prefix does not alter the routing of a
   TLP. TLPs are routed based on the routing rules covered in Section
   2.2.4 .

As the Requester ID/PASID combination forms a distinct address space. The
memory address based routing is not compatible for PASID TLPs anymore.
Therefore we have to rely on ACS to override that default.

This enhances pci_enable_pasid() interface by requiring the ACS features
to be enabled for the entire path leading to the device. So that even if
the TLP looks like a P2P Request because its memory address (ignoring the
PASID) would fall in a bridge window and would normally be routed
downstream.

Best regards,
baolu
