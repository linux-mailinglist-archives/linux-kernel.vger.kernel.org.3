Yes, I was thinking the same thing.  There's no reason we need to wait
until interrupts are disabled to disable PTM.

I like this second idea of dropping this "PCI/PTM: fix to maintain
pci_dev->ptm_enabled" patch and using "dev->ptm_enabled" to set the
PTM Enable bit on restore, as in the patches below.  Then we don't
need to do anything explicit to re-enable PTM.

If this makes sense, I'll add a few cleanups on top and post as a
formal series.

commit 73690aa361a7 ("PCI/PM: Always disable PTM for all devices during suspend")
Author: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 1 16:14:45 2022 -0500

    PCI/PM: Always disable PTM for all devices during suspend
    
    We want to disable PTM on Root Ports because that allows some chips, e.g.,
    Intel mobile chips since Coffee Lake, to enter a lower-power PM state.
    
    That means we also have to disable PTM on downstream devices because PCIe
    r6.0, sec 2.2.8, strongly recommends that functions support generation of
    messages in non-D0 states, so we assume Switch Upstream Ports or Endpoints
    may send PTM Requests while in D1, D2, and D3hot.  A PTM message received
    by a Downstream Port (including a Root Port) with PTM disabled must be
    treated as an Unsupported Request (sec 6.21.3).
    
    PTM was previously disabled only for Root Ports, and it was disabled in
    pci_prepare_to_sleep(), which is not called at all if a driver supports
    legacy PM or does its own state saving.
    
    Instead, disable PTM early in pci_pm_suspend() and pci_pm_runtime_suspend()
    so we do it in all cases.

Author: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 1 15:51:23 2022 -0500

    PCI/PTM: Enable PTM when restoring state
    
    The suspend path may disable PTM before saving config state, which means
    the PCI_PTM_CTRL_ENABLE bit in the saved state may be cleared even though
    we want PTM to be enabled when resuming.
    
    If "dev->ptm_enabled" is set, it means PTM should be enabled, so make sure
    PCI_PTM_CTRL_ENABLE is set when restoring the PTM state.

commit 1d7d32a35df0 ("PCI/PTM: Preserve PTM Root Select")
Author: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 1 15:54:15 2022 -0500

    PCI/PTM: Preserve PTM Root Select
    
    When disabling PTM, there's no need to clear the Root Select bit.  We
    disable PTM during suspend, and we want to re-enable it during resume.
    Clearing Root Select here makes re-enabling more complicated.
    
    Per PCIe r6.0, sec 7.9.15.3, "When set, if the PTM Enable bit is also Set,
    this Time Source is the PTM Root," so if PTM Enable is cleared, the value
    of Root Select should be irrelevant.
    
    Preserve Root Select to simplify re-enabling PTM.
