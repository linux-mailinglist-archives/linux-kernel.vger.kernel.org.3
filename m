direct you how to claim and get the fund without any problem. I also
advise you to feel free because it's 100% legal and risk free.

Though, I know it would come to you at uttermost surprise and unbelief
because its internet contact and it's virtually impossible to know who
is trustworthy and who to believed but don't be afraid you will not
regret of dealing with me, I want you to help me to claim and receive
the fund to your account in your country where it will share between
me and you for our own benefit.

I am aware of the unsafe nature of the internet and was compelled to
use this medium due to the nature of this project. I have access to
every vital information that can be used to transfer the fund, which
may culminate into the investment of the said funds into your account
or any lucrative company in your country.

If you would like to assist me as a partner then kindly indicate your
interest, after which we shall both discuss the modalities and the
sharing percentage. Upon receipt of your reply on your expression of
interest, I will give you full details on how the business will be
