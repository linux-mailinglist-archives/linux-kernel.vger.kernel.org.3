I meant exactly the case you've described as the main goal of the
named properties. My worry was that by using the pattern:

reg-names:
  items:
    - const: name
    - const: another_name
    - const: one_more_name

you get to fix the names order, which they were invented to get rid
from. If you get to use that pattern the only optional names could be
the names at the tail of the array, which isn't always applicable. In
that case you'd have no choice but to use the pattern suggested by
me.
