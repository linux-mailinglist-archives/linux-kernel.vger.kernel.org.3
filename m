Sorry for the delay; I have been rather swamped recently and haven't had the
time to give this the time it needs.

I'm happy with patches 1 and 2, and I've acked those in case Will wants to pick
them.

Kalesh (cc'd) is working to share the unwinder code with hyp, and I think that
we need to take a step back and consider how we can make the design work
cleanly with that. I'd had a go at prototyping making the unwinder more data
driven, but I haven't come up with something satisfactory so far.

It would be good if you could look at / comment on each others series.

Thanks,
Mark.
