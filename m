Right. For MSI this means that pci_alloc_irq_vectors() in probe should
be matched by pci_free_irq_vectors() on remove.

For legacy interrupts, which can be shared, the mapping is created by
PCI core when binding to the first device and can only be disposed by
the host-bridge driver once all descendants have been removed.

The endpoint drivers still need to disable their interrupts of course.

Buggy endpoint-driver remove implementations can lead to all sorts of
crashes (e.g. after failing to deregister a class device), and if that's
a worry then don't unload modules (and possibly disable it completely
using CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD).

As mentioned earlier in this thread, we only appear to have some 60
drivers in the entire tree that bother to try to implement that. I fear
that blocking the use of modules (including being able to unload them)
will just make people submit drivers that can only be built in.

Not everyone cares about Android's GKI, but being able to unload a
module during development is very useful (and keeping that out-of-tree
prevents sharing the implementation and make it susceptible to even
further bit rot).

So continuing to supporting modules properly is a win for everyone (e.g.
GKI and developers).

Just as you are if an endpoint-driver fails to clean up after itself in
some other way (e.g. leaves the interrupt enabled).
