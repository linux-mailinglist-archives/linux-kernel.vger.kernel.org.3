A parser in userspace is preferred to one in kernel since if there is
a bug somewhere its consequences are much less severe.
And experience shows that parsers are especially prone to bugs.
A userspace implementation can also be tightly sandboxed for extra
security.

There are many existing OpenPGP parsing libraries to choose from.

I understand but it would be great to make use as much as possible of
the existing in-kernel signature verification mechanisms.
