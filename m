As I said in my previous reply, I don't want a config option for this.

Adding an option now would revert the behaviour back to the way it was,
which has the potential to break things, as you described.

Maybe we shouldn't have changed the numbering to begin with, but it's
been 6 years, so it's too late to change it back.

cheers
