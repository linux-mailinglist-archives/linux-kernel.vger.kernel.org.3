I am pretty certain that these names do not change for a device once it's
been released. The full ID of the uefisecapp is "qcom.tz.uefisecapp". The
built-in firmware parts here are core components. So I really do not expect
them to just remove or rename things. If they would do that, that would
mean that, on Windows, access to things like the TPM or UEFI variables
would be broken if both the driver and Registry are not updated in parallel
with the firmware. So while I can't myself guarantee that this is a stable
name and interface, it's very much in MS/Qualcomm's interest to keep it
stable.

Also, I'm not advocating on putting loads of details in the DT. I'm (in
this series) advocating for a DT compatible that says "this device stores
EFI variables via that firmware interface". I'd be very surprised if
MS/Qualcomm suddenly decided to change that out for another interface,
potentially breaking their own software and devices.

 From userspace? For access to EFI variables and (hopefully in the future
if I've managed to reverse-engineer that) the TPM? Those are things that
should work out-of-the-box and not require the user to first have to
configure something... Also, those are things that the kernel might want
to use (e.g. EFI variables as pstore for crashdumps) before the user is
even able to configure something (unless we now want to specify things
on the kernel command line...).

If this were something that only userspace would use then sure, let
userspace load it and do all the work. But it isn't.

So as soon as access runs via some firmware mechanism, it should not be
in the DT? The TPM in the example above would also be accessed via some
firmware API. EFI variables are stored on some SPI flash that is managed
by the TrustZone. So in both cases kernel calls to firmware calls to
device. Where do you draw the line?

I did say that there is an API that turns a unique identifying string ID
of a secure application into a runtime-dependent integer ID of the
running application, returning an error if the application is not
running. I very much doubt that is supposed to be used for checking
support of certain applications. It could _maybe_ be used that way, but
the Windows driver doesn't, which makes me not very comfortable doing
that either.

Further: As far as I can tell, there is also no way of checking whether
that lookup failure is due to the application not being present or whether
something internal to the firmware failed. the respective results that the
call can (as far as I can tell) return are:

	QCTEE_OS_RESULT_SUCCESS			= 0,
	QCTEE_OS_RESULT_INCOMPLETE		= 1,
	QCTEE_OS_RESULT_BLOCKED_ON_LISTENER	= 2,
	QCTEE_OS_RESULT_FAILURE			= 0xFFFFFFFF,

And it will return QCTEE_OS_RESULT_FAILURE when the app name is wrong.

Again, while it _might_ be possible to use that, I don't think it makes a
very sound approach and I would really prefer not using it in that way.

Max
