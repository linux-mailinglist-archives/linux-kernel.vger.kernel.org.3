Hi Rob,
Apologies for replying late.

I get your concern. Yes we can remove the "multiport" node and instead 
define the
USB phy phandles all in one place. Still I would need to add support for 
both generic-phy and
usb-phy framework as downstream many vendors are using "usb-phy" and 
it's supported by ACK as well.
This would not regress anything with Generic PHY.

@Greg can you please comment as ACK has support for usb-phy framework.

Now coming to implementation, let's consider a 4 port USB multiport 
controller having
4 HS PHYs and 2 SS PHYs.Â  We can have two approaches here

#1 -> If we could mandate using "HS" or "SS" as substring in
phy-names or usb-phy, then we can calculate number of HS and SS phy and 
also get
corresponding PHY nodes. Only concern here is that downstream vendors 
might need
to change their existing usb-phy names and add proper substring if they 
are not doing so ;

phy = <&usb-hs-phy>,<&usb-ss-phy>,
       <&usb-hs-phy1>, <&usb-ss-phy1>,
       <&usb-hs-phy2>, <&usb-hs-phy3>;

phy-names = "port0-hs", "port0-ss", "port1-hs", "port1-ss", "port2-hs",
    "port3-hs";


OR


#2-> We could mandate defining the USB phy in HS - SS pairs.
For ports that has only HS PHY, we would need to define usb_nop_phy in 
SS place.
Then we can calculate the number of HS & SS phys and get corresponding
PHY nodes by using simple fact that HS phy would be defined at odd places &
SS phy defined at even. Here substrings are not mandated.

phy = <&usb-hs-phy>,<&usb-qmp-phy>,
       <&usb-hs-phy1>, <&usb-qmp-phy1>,
       <&usb-hs-phy2>, <&usb_nop_phy>
       <&usb-hs-phy3>, <&usb_nop_phy>;

phy-names = "port0-hs", "port0-ss",
	    "port1-hs", "port1-ss",
	    "port2-hs", "usb-nop",
	    "port3-hs", "usb-nop";


Please let me know if you prefer any approach here or have any suggestions.
