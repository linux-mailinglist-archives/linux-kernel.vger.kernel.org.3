I mentioned this in a previous post, but it is clear the Author's intent was for
this only to apply to powernv and pseries platforms. However, it only really
checks for powernv, and if that fails it does a read the reg property for the
domain which works for and PPC platform. If we really only want this on powernv
and pseries and revert all other PPC platforms back we can fix this with a
pseries check instead of a config property. Using ibm,fw-phb-id instead of reg
property if ibm,opal-phbid lookup fails does the trick.
