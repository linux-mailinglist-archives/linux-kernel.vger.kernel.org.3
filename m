Yes.  I think it may be better to demote from fast memory nodes only in
such cases.  We just free some fast memory proactively.  But we may
reclaim from the slow memory node (which are demotion targets) if
necessary.

> In any case, we will not reclaim from slow memory for demotion,

If there's no free pages in the slow memory to accommodate the demoted
pages, why not just reclaim some pages in the slow memory?  What are the
disadvantages to do that?

> if that is the middle thing you refer to.

No.  I mean,

If we reclaim "A" pages proactively, we will free "A" pages, maybe from
slow memory firstly.  The target is the total memory size of a memcg.

If we demote "A" pages proactively, we will demote "A" pages from fast
memory to slow memory.  The target is the fast memory size of a memcg.
In the process, some slow memory may be reclaimed to accommodate the
demoted pages.

For me, the middle thing is,

If we demote some pages from fast memory to slow memory proactively and
free some pages from slow memory at the same time, the total number
(demote + free) is "A".  There's no clear target.  I think this is
confusing.  Per my understanding, you don't suggest this too.

Yes.  Both seems work.
