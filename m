Yes,

I just found that Ming's patch introduce a new problem:

If multiple bios are throttled, then they will be issued one by one with
corresponding time. However, after Ming's patch, all throttled bios will
be issued immediately once the waiting time of first bio is reached. And
such behaviour is definitely a problem...

Agreed, the solution sounds reasonable. And this problem is found during
test, which issue a large io and in the meantime updating config with
random value.
