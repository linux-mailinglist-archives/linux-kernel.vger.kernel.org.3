I am aware of that and hence I am happy to see these as one off drivers
if needed. But if we don't stop that or keep converting them to DT,
IMO we will be in vicious circle of this conversion and will never be
able to support ACPI natively on these platforms. I know it is huge
effort and not expecting that to be done here, but we need to convey the
message to use ACPI standards or improve it if there is a need. Using
PEP is not helpful to run Linux in the long run. Also we may hit a point
when it may not be trivial to do that ACPI<->DT conversion.

Agreed and I don't want to block any such discussions. Sorry if I derailed
the discussion, that was not my intentions.
