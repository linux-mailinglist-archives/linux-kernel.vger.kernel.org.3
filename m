Can we close on this?  Splitting into

  (a) stuff that can be initialized before the link is available and
  (b) stuff that depends on the link

makes good sense, but then (b) should only contain stuff that actually
depends on the link.

The "PCIe->SCB endian mode for BAR" *sounds* like something related to
the primary side of the RP, not the link.

Not sure about "Refclk from RC".  RC would certainly be primary side,
but ASPM has to do with secondary (link) side.
