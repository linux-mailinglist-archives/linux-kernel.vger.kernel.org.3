OK, so you effectivelly want to keep the memory protection when there is
a "normal" memory pressure but want to relax the protection on other
high memory utilization situations?

How do you exactly tell a difference between a steady memory pressure
(say stream IO on the page cache) from "high load APP launched"? Should
you reduce the protection on the stram IO situation as well?

Why existing tools/APIs are insufficient for that? You can watch for
both global and memcg memory pressure including PSI metrics and update
limits dynamically. Why is it necessary to put such a logic into the
kernel?
