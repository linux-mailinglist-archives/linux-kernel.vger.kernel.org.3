So I'd find the logic easier to follow if you completely removed
entity->in_groups_with_pending_reqs and did updates of
bfqd->num_groups_with_pending_reqs like:

	if (!bfqg->num_entities_with_pending_reqs++)
		bfqd->num_groups_with_pending_reqs++;

and similarly on the remove side. And there would we literally two places
(addition & removal from weight tree) that would need to touch these
counters. Pretty obvious and all can be done in patch 9.
