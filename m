Can you please make an effort to send patches in coherent way? Here's
what I see in my email reader:

[PATCH RFC V2 00/10] irqchip: Add LoongArch-related irqchip drivers
+[PATCH RFC V3 01/11] APCI: irq: Add support for multiple GSI domains
+[PATCH RFC V3 02/11] genirq/generic_chip: export irq_unmap_generic_chip

\[PATCH RFC V3 05/11] irqchip: create library file for LoongArch irqchip driver
[PATCH RFC V3 06/11] irqchip/loongson-pch-pic: Add ACPI init support
+[PATCH RFC V3 07/11] irqchip/loongson-pch-msi: Add ACPI init support

+[PATCH RFC V3 09/11] irqchip/loongson-liointc: Add ACPI init support

\[PATCH RFC V3 11/11] irqchip: Add Loongson PCH LPC controller support
[PATCH RFC V3 00/11] irqchip: Add LoongArch-related irqchip drivers

Three threads, with inconsistent version numbers, inconsistent patch
numbering, with a split in the middle, and this final cover letter
that isn't followed by anything.  If you make a mistake, that's
fine. Fix it, and resend the series properly, possibly with a new
version number. Pro tip: you should only use 'git send-email', and
only once to send all your patches after having written the cover
letter. If you have to do anything else, you're doing something
wrong.

Also, please drop this 'RFC', as we're way past the RFC stage (to me,
RFC means "I don't know what I'm doing yet, this is not ready to be
merged").

I'm usually not too attached to authorship, but I definitely wrote
that one, and that casts some doubt on the authorship of all the
patches. For example, patch #4 has:

Signed-off-by: Huacai Chen <chenhuacai@loongson.cn>
Signed-off-by: Jianmin Lv <lvjianmin@loongson.cn>

but doesn't list Huacai Chen as the author. Either they are, and the
patch needs a From: line like in patch #3, or this is co-developed,
and you need the Co-Developed: tag ([1] has all the details).

I'll go and review the actual patches before the end of the week, but
you definitely need to address the patch attributions in this series.

Thanks,

	M.
