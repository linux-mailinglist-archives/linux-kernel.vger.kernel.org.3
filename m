right. But I don't think the original protection is soft which could
be proved by the test result that the memcg is protected in a certain
range of pressure and could also help to release the system by
breaking low limit.

I don't follow. Does it mean that the protected should distinguish the
pressure from global and other memcgs? I don't know why.

Actually, the purpose of this patch is to free the userspace during
runtime which require proper setup of parameter and then let the
scheme decide rest things.

This kind of memcg is supposed to be used by the user who is aware of
the scheme and would like the scheme to perform as it is.

As I have mentioned before, EAS scheduler is also a self-motivating
scheme which is based on load tracking and energy calculation. The
user could also be hard to know when the schedule entity could be
scheduled to big core. The admin could turn it off if dislike.
I would like to push this patch forward and get more feedback from
real scenarios.
