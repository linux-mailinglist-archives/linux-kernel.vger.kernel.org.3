Even that discussion doesn't really explain the real underlying problem.
There are statements about inefficiency and trashing without any further
details or clarifications.

My very vague understanding is that the Android system would like to
freeze specific applications and for that it requires each application
to live in its own cgroup. This clashes with a requirement to age and
reclaim memory on a different granularity (aka no per process reclaim).
So in fact something that cgroup v1 would achieve by having 2
hierarchies, one for the freezer which would have a dedicated cgroup for
each application and the other for the memory controller where tasks are
grouped by a different criteria. This would rule out that a global (or
any external memory pressure) reclaim would age LRUs that contain a mix
bag of application pages rather than iterate over per-application LRUs.
Is that understanding correct?
