My primary goal was to apply the memory pressure on memory cgroups with a lot
of (dying) children cgroups. On a multi-cpu machine a memory cgroup structure
is way larger than a page, so a cgroup which looks small can be really large
if we calculate the amount of memory taken by all children memcg internals.

Applying this pressure to another cgroup (e.g. the one which contains systemd)
doesn't help to reclaim any pages which are pinning the dying cgroups.

For other controllers (maybe blkcg aside, idk) it shouldn't matter, because
there is no such problem there.

For consistency reasons I'd suggest to charge all *large* allocations
(e.g. percpu) to the parent cgroup. Small allocations can be ignored.

Thanks!
