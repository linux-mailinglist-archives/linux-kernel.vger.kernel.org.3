While implementing the new method, I found that there seems to be a
misunderstanding here, the code seems to try to add flag to split bio
so that it won't be throttled again for bps limit, however:

1) for blk throttle, split bio is issued directly and will never be
throttled again, while orignal bio will go through throttle path again.
2) if cloned bio is directed to a new disk, the flag is cleared anyway.
