Hi,

 This is a new patch series made around a discrete patch submitted earlier 
on that has gone nowhere, which is now 1/4.  That change handles $PIR PIRQ 
routing tables that lack router device information, fixing the inability 
to route interrupts with a system using the SiS85C497 ISA bridge.  It has 
been minimally updated from v1 by including router device information 
reported with the change description, and by adding Nikolai's Tested-by 
annotation.

 Then 2/4 adds support for the $IRT PIRQ routing table format invented by 
AMI before Microsoft has come up with its own $PIR format.  These formats 
are very similar to each other, but the $IRT format does not provide for 
router device information, so this change relies on 1/4.  It has turned 
out needed to route interrupts with a system using the ALi M1487 ISA Bus 
Controller device, discussed earlier on in a discussion thread around: 
<https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/61377A45.8030003@gmail.com/>.  This 
change has been verified with an artificially created $IRT table and 
hopefully Nikolai will be able to verify this code with his system as 
well.

 Then 3/4 corrects our link value interpretation for said M1487 device 
according to Nikolai's findings with his system reported here: 
<https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/61428EDF.9030203@gmail.com/>.

 Finally 4/4 corrects a couple of coding style issues around though not 
immediately within code changed by 2/4 so as to make the style consistent.

 See individual change descriptions for further details.

 Credit to Michal (cc-ed) for helping me chase documentation for the
$IRT table format.

 Please apply.
