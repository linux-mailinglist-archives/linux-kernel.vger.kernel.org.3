Yes I have seen that. 

1. Will that differ with ACPI on juno ?

2. Is that a problem ? I mean we are fixing those masks that are user
visible with this series and if using them as is in sched domain is
incorrect or not sufficient, we need to fix that. We can't change these
masks.

OK good.

Indeed, I will leave that to scheduler experts ðŸ˜‰. My main goal is to get
the topology masks that are user visible right and keeping current behavior
intact.

Yes, we already have all these complex conditions in cpu_coregroup_mask.
Why not do something similar in cpu_clustergroup_mask ?

I don't know. We have all the topology and llc info now, we need to decide
how to present them to scheduler.

Me neither. I avoided these changes for years because of such complex
questions but that is wrong reason to, as the user visible topology has
now diverged from ACPI once(people who complained about user space breakage
cared only about ACPI) and we need to bring them in parity soon IMO.
