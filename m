Which brings me to another point.

Technically nothing seems to prevent an ima_ns to survive the
destruction of its associated userns in ima_ns->user_ns?

One thread does get_ima_ns() and mucks around with it while another one
does put_user_ns().

Assume it's the last reference to the userns which is now -
asynchronously - cleaned up from ->work. So at some point you're ending
with a dangling pointer in ima_ns->user_ns eventually causing a UAF.

If I'm thinking correct than you need to fix this. I can think of two
ways right now where one of them I'm not sure how well that would work:
1. ima_ns takes a reference count to userns at creation. Here you need
   to make very sure that you're not ending up with reference counting
   cycles where the two structs keep each other alive.
2. rcu trickery. That's the one I'm not sure how well that would work
   where you'd need rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() with a
   get_user_ns() in the middle whenever you're trying to get a ref to
   the userns from an ima_ns and handle the case where the userns is
   gone.

Or maybe I'me missing something in the patch series that makes this all
a non-issue.
