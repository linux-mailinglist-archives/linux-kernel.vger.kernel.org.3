You are completly right. It is possible that I would like to be able to
*abuse* the restart handlers as notifier. You are right that we have a
reboot_notifier but it is not good enough for my usecase - it is only
called, well, on reboot. It is not called in case of emergency_restart()
so in case of a panic, this won't happen. It also is called much earlier
than restart handlers which also makes a difference in some cases. So I
see no other choice than to abuse the restart_handler mechanism for that.

So, ideally, for that usecase, we would need a restart notifier that is
called immidietely before restart handlers, is basically done in the
same way as reset_handlers mechanism, but would simply be called
differently and would use separate chain. But does it make sense to have
that?

Apart from this simple usecase that I have focused so far, I also have
another one that I didn't mention before. As you know, even efi_reboot()
has several types of resets it can trigger (warm, cold), depending on
how "deep" the reset should be. In some cases, however, we have a need to
escalate the reset/reboot even deeper, into full board reset which is
performed by an external component - this cannot be done from EFI
firmware so we have to do this from Linux, before efi_reboot is called.
This has to be done also in case of a emergency_restart(). And obviosly
we do not call efi_reboot() in this case, as the whole board goes into
reset, including the CPU. This reset is, however, conditional -
it does not replace the efi_reboot() which is still used in most cases.
We use restart_handlers also for that, but this doesn't work on ARM64 with
EFI.

As explained above, I am aware of them but they have their limitation.
They were designed for slightly different usecase. The are designed
around blocking_notfier and are supposed to be called only in still safe
environment during graceful reboot, quite early in the reboot process.
If you need to do something just before reset and/or in case of a panic,
you are out of luck.
Of course reset_handlers have their limitations too. For one, they are
called in the context of atomic_notifier and we can't assume the system
is in good condition when it is called but trying to flip a GPIO line or
do a write to MMIO register is a sane thing to do here.
