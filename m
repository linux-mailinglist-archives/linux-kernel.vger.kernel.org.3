first, thank you very much, Lino, for working on this! I've been debugging
issues with the tis driver in the last days and was about to start with the same
approach as yours when I luckily discovered your patch!

Jarkko, while I agree, that the commit message is not optimal, Lino tried hard
to explain what the problems with the current code are and how they are / can be
fixed. Further, I too don't see why simplification / optimization is such a bad
thing. This driver is actually a very good example. I had a hard time, too,
figuring out what's going on there. A clean rewrite is a very valid approach
here IMO. It's not "polishing for nothing", as you described it, but actually
solving problems.

Interrupt detection is broken for years now and finally a volunteer worked on a
solution. Don't you think this should be valued? Let's get this problem sorted
out :-)

Lino, I'd be happy to test the patches, when you have time and interest to work
on this again!

Thanks, Michael
