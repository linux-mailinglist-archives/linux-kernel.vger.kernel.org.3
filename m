Just a note -- this another usecase of cgroups created from within the
subtree (e.g. a container). I agree that cgroup-manager/systemd case is
also valid (as dying memcgs may accumulate after a restart).

memcgs with their retained state with footprint are special.

Strictly speaking, this would mean that any controller would have on
implicit dependency on the memory controller (such as io controller
has).
In the extreme case even controller-less hierarchy would have such a
requirement (for precise kernfs_node accounting).
Such a dependency is not enforceable on v1 (with various topologies of
different hierarchies).
Although, I initially favored the consistency with memory controller too,
I think it's simpler to charge to the creator's memcg to achieve
consistency across v1 and v2 :-)
