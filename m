I will try to persuade you that it is not that uncommon scenario,
see below.

I do not undestand this argument. The data are useless without the
code. The code is needed to remove the data. Therefore the code should
stay until the data are released.

I am talking about data using statically defined kobj_type in modules.

This is exactly what I am proposing. If the kobject release callbacks
are defined in the module then the module should stay as long as
they are needed.

There seems to be 14 simple modules that define static strcut
kobj_type:

$> for file in `git grep "static struct kobj_type" | cut -d : -f1 | sort -u` ; \
       do grep -q "module_init" $file && echo $file ; \
   done
arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh4/sq.c
drivers/block/pktcdvd.c
drivers/firmware/dmi-sysfs.c
drivers/firmware/efi/efivars.c
drivers/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg.c
drivers/net/bonding/bond_main.c
drivers/net/ethernet/ibm/ibmveth.c
drivers/parisc/pdc_stable.c
drivers/platform/x86/dell/dell-wmi-sysman/sysman.c
drivers/platform/x86/intel/uncore-frequency.c
drivers/platform/x86/uv_sysfs.c
drivers/uio/uio.c
kernel/livepatch/core.c
samples/kobject/kset-example.c


The other struct kobj_type are fined in 81 source files:

$> for file in `git grep "static struct kobj_type" | cut -d : -f1 | sort -u` ;  \
      do grep -q "module_init" $file || echo $file ; \
   done | wc -l
81


I believe that most of them might be compiled as modules as well.
There are many non-trivial drivers and file systes. From just a quick
look:

drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx4/sysfs.c
fs/btrfs/sysfs.c
fs/ext4/sysfs.c


Well, we should probably discuss this in the original thread
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211129034509.2646872-3-ming.lei@redhat.com
