The 2nd io arrived at 1s, the wait time is 4s, i.e. it can be dispatched
at 5s (i.e. 10k/*2kB/s = 5s).

This looks like it was calculated at time 4s (1s after new config was
set).

This looks like calculated at 4s, so the IO would be waiting till
4s+5.5s = 9.5s.

As I don't know why using time 4s, I'll shift this calculation to the
time 3s (when the config changes):

bytes_disp = 0.5k, slice_start =  0,
bytes_allowed = 1k * 3  = 3k
extra_bytes =  0.5k + 9k - 3k = 7.5k
wait = 7.5s

In absolute time, the IO would wait till 3s+7.5s = 10.5s

OK, either your 9.5s or my 10.5s looks weird (although earlier than
original 4s+8s=12s).
However, the IO should ideally only wait till

    3s + (9k -   (6k    -    1k)     ) / 1k/s =
         bio - (allowed - dispatched)  / new_limit

   =3s + 4k / 1k/s = 7s

   ('allowed' is based on old limit)

Or in another example, what if you change the config from 2k/s to âˆžk/s
(unlimited, let's neglect the arithmetic overflow that you handle
explicitly, imagine a big number but not so big to be greater than
division result).

In such a case, the wait time should be zero, i.e. IO should be
dispatched right at the time of config change.
(With your patch that still calculates >0 wait time (and the original
behavior gives >0 wait too.)

> I hope I can expliain it clearly...

Yes, thanks for pointing me to relevant parts.
I hope I grasped them correctly.

IOW, your patch and formula make the wait time shorter but still IO can
be delayed indefinitely if you pass a sequence of new configs. (AFAIU)
