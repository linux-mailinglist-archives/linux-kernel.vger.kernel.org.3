This is pci-mvebu.c driver specific, it does not implement emulation of
neither INTx, nor MSI interrupts for emulated pci bridge (root port). As
we know this HW does not have compliant pci root port, it needs to be
emulated in driver, and emulation for interrupts is missing. (it means
that also AER interrupt is missing).

And pci-aardvark.c driver has same issue and similar patch is required
for pci-aardvark.c too. Marek should take care of it. But for
pci-aardvark we already have implementation which emulates INTx
interrupts and it is waiting for review on the list:

I'm not sure... maybe. I choose this style as after I implement
emulation of INTx interrupts it allows me just to replace "return 0;" by
"return my_mapping_function_for_root_port(...);". Similarly like it is
in pending pci-aardvark.c patch:

Exactly. All devices except emulated root ports (which are on bus 0)
have working MSI, MSI-X and INTx interrupts.
