Okay, I'll work on implementing this then.

Understood, thank you.

Understood, I apologize if I'm being difficult here, I just want to
make sure I completely understand the assignment.
Your comment about kexec made it clear for me, thank you.

Once again, you'll have no argument from me in this regard.
I've had several blocks of hardware enablement sitting out of tree
waiting for the phy code to land.
As much testing as my branch has seen, it's still only a drop in the
bucket compared to finally being mainlined.
I appreciate all of your effort and review here and I absolutely want
this done correctly.

I think resetting the whole core is the best move, since it's the only
way we can guarantee a sane configuration with the documentation we
have.
