Events are still at version 1.01:
    https://download.01.org/perfmon/GLP
Json files generated by the latest code at:
    https://github.com/intel/event-converter-for-linux-perf

The addition of a floating-point.json is due to events having
their topic better identified by the converter script.

Not tested on a GoldmontPlus, on a SkylakeX:

iencies. I.e. when front-end of the machine is not delivering uops to the b=

tify if the machine is truly front-end bound.  When this event occurs, it i=
s an indication that the front-end of the machine is operating at less than=
 its theoretical peak performance. Background: We can think of the processo=
r pipeline as being divided into 2 broader parts: Front-end and Back-end. F=
ront-end is responsible for fetching the instruction, decoding into uops in=
 machine understandable format and putting them into a uop queue to be cons=
umed by back end. The back-end then takes these uops, allocates the require=
d resources.  When all resources are ready, uops are executed. If the back-=
end is not ready to accept uops from the front-end, then we do not want to =
count these as front-end bottlenecks.  However, whenever we have bottleneck=
s in the back-end, we will have allocation unit stalls and eventually forci=
ng the front-end to wait until the back-end is ready to receive more uops. =
This event counts only when back-end is requesting more uops and front-end =
is not able to provide them. When 3 uops are requested and no uops are deli=
vered, the event counts 3. When 3 are requested, and only 1 is delivered, t=
he event counts 2. When only 2 are delivered, the event counts 1. Alternati=
vely stated, the event will not count if 3 uops are delivered, or if the ba=
ck end is stalled and not requesting any uops at all.  Counts indicate miss=
ed opportunities for the front-end to deliver a uop to the back end. Some e=
xamples of conditions that cause front-end efficiencies are: ICache misses,=
 ITLB misses, and decoder restrictions that limit the front-end bandwidth. =
Known Issues: Some uops require multiple allocation slots.  These uops will=
 not be charged as a front end 'not delivered' opportunity, and will be reg=
arded as a back end problem. For example, the INC instruction has one uop t=
hat requires 2 issue slots.  A stream of INC instructions will not count as=
 UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED, even though only one instruction can be issued per clo=
ck.  The low uop issue rate for a stream of INC instructions is considered =
to be a back end issue.",

iencies. I.e. when front-end of the machine is not delivering uops to the b=
ack-end and the back-end has is not stalled. This event can be used to iden=
tify if the machine is truly front-end bound.  When this event occurs, it i=
s an indication that the front-end of the machine is operating at less than=
 its theoretical peak performance. Background: We can think of the processo=
r pipeline as being divided into 2 broader parts: Front-end and Back-end. F=
ront-end is responsible for fetching the instruction, decoding into uops in=
 machine understandable format and putting them into a uop queue to be cons=
umed by back end. The back-end then takes these uops, allocates the require=
d resources.  When all resources are ready, uops are executed. If the back-=
end is not ready to accept uops from the front-end, then we do not want to =
count these as front-end bottlenecks.  However, whenever we have bottleneck=
s in the back-end, we will have allocation unit stalls and eventually forci=
ng the front-end to wait until the back-end is ready to receive more uops. =
This event counts only when back-end is requesting more uops and front-end =
is not able to provide them. When 3 uops are requested and no uops are deli=
vered, the event counts 3. When 3 are requested, and only 1 is delivered, t=
he event counts 2. When only 2 are delivered, the event counts 1. Alternati=
vely stated, the event will not count if 3 uops are delivered, or if the ba=
ck end is stalled and not requesting any uops at all.  Counts indicate miss=
ed opportunities for the front-end to deliver a uop to the back end. Some e=
xamples of conditions that cause front-end efficiencies are: ICache misses,=
 ITLB misses, and decoder restrictions that limit the front-end bandwidth. =
Known Issues: Some uops require multiple allocation slots.  These uops will=
 not be charged as a front end 'not delivered' opportunity, and will be reg=
arded as a back end problem. For example, the INC instruction has one uop t=
hat requires 2 issue slots.  A stream of INC instructions will not count as=
 UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED, even though only one instruction can be issued per clo=
ck.  The low uop issue rate for a stream of INC instructions is considered =
to be a back end issue.",
