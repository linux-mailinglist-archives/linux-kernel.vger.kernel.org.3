What's the rationale of making it negative?

We adjust total pages and managed pages to simulate what memory is
actually available to the system (just like during memory hot(un)plug).
Even though the pages are "allocated" by the driver, they are actually
unusable for the system, just as if they would have been offlined.
Strictly speaking, the guest OS can kill as many processes as it wants,
it cannot reclaim that memory, as it's logically no longer available.

There is nothing (valid, well, except driver unloading) the guest can do
to reuse these pages. The hypervisor has to get involved first to grant
access to some of these pages again (deflate the balloon).

It's different with deflate-on-oom: the guest will *itself* decide to
reuse inflated pages to deflate them. So the allocated pages can become
back usable easily. There was a recent discussion for virtio-balloon to
change that behavior when it's known that the hypervisor essentially
implements "deflate-on-oom" by looking at guest memory stats and
adjusting the balloon size accordingly; however, as long as we don't
know what the hypervisor does or doesn't do, we have to keep the
existing behavior.

Note that most balloon drivers under Linux share that behavior.

In case of Hyper-V I remember a customer BUG report that requested that
exact behavior, however, I'm not able to locate the BZ quickly.

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/virtualization/2021-November/057767.html
(note that I can't easily find the original mail in the archives)

Note: I suggested under [1] to expose inflated pages via /proc/meminfo
directly. We could do that consistently over all balloon drivers ...
doesn't sound too crazy.
