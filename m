Unfortunately, problems with kexec are not limited to the unaccepted
memory. Isaku pointed out that MADT CPU wake is also problematic for
kexec. It doesn't allow CPU offline so secondary kernel will not be able
to wake it up. So additional limitation (as of now) for kexec is !SMP on
TDX guest.

I guess we can implement CPU offlining by going to a loop that checks
mailbox and responds to the command. That loops has to be somehow
protected from being overwritten on kexec.

Other issues may come up as we actually try to implement it.

That's all doable, but feels like a scope creep for unaccepted memory
enabling patchset :/

Is it a must for merge consideration?

I tried to limit KEXEC on Kconfig level before[1]. Naive approach does not work[2]:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for UNACCEPTED_MEMORY
  Depends on [n]: EFI [=y] && EFI_STUB [=y] && !KEXEC_CORE [=y]
  Selected by [y]:
  - INTEL_TDX_GUEST [=y] && HYPERVISOR_GUEST [=y] && X86_64 [=y] && CPU_SUP_INTEL [=y] && X86_X2APIC [=y]

Maybe my Kconfig-fu is not strong enough, I donno.

Sounds straight-forward. I can do this.
