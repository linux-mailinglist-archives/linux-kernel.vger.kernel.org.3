If both of those were true, and if the key was never reused for other purposes
(either for other hash algorithms or for full file hashes), that would be fine.
Obviously, the IMA policy is trusted in this context, since it's what tells the
kernel to verify signatures in the first place.

But, I could see users getting this wrong and reusing keys.

There isn't an inconsistency.  ECDSA is among the algorithms where the caller is
expected to handle the hash.

It is confusing dealing with all these different signature algorithms.  I think
the right way to think about this is in terms of what *data* is being
signed/verified.  Currently the data is the full file contents.  I think it
needs to be made into an annotated hash, e.g. the struct I gave.

public_key_verify_signature() also needs to be fixed to support both types of
signature algorithms (caller-provided hash and internal hash) in a logical way.
Originally it only supported caller-provided hashes, but then SM2 support was
added and now it is super broken.

That seems like a good thing, unless you want users to be responsible for only
ever signing full file hashes *or* fs-verity file hashes with each key.  That
seems like something that users will get wrong.
