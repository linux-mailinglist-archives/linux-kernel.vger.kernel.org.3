Yes. I'll fix the comments up and try and get this out later in the
week. I hope the GPIO patch is easier and can be merged on its own.

It would be great if someone at SiFive could comment on this, I don't
really have a lot of info other than this doesn't work for any of our
boards. I just assume that everyone else boots from NVME and it just
works for them.

I am not sure on this either, all I have is a pair of Unmatched boards
and neither work without this fix in. Has the FU740 been used by anyone
other than this board?

I have not verified with a speed test any of this yet. It should do
2.5GT/s as initial probe and then attempt to get the link back to
the maximum speed once the device has probed. It seems once the
ASM2824 has done the first initialisation it will then continue
back at the higher speed.

Once the ASM2824 is working it seems the rest will follow.

Ok, will do.

So what I've seen is if U-boot does the initial probe at 2.5GT/s and
then Linux comes along and does the reset itself, the LINKCAP gets
set back to the original full speed then the device probe works under
Linux. I've not verified with any NVME speed test yet.

I think so, the only verification I have done is lspci to check what
the link is reporting.

Ok, if no-one has a better idea I am just going to return the error
code for now.
