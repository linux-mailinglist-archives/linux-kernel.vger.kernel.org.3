This is fine for userspace access, but I think we probably will want retries
once we are using it in kernel.  Whilst we'd not expect it to be common as
per (very late) reply I sent to v13 discussion, the CDAT table can change
all on it's own (as far as software can see).  I'd expect it to be a once in
a blue moon thing though.
