There is no particular appliance/architecture targeted. This card should
work with any system that can support PCIe.

Previous answer does rule out this one.

Ok, this is however not doable on many already existing platforms since
it would require to adapt this system for whatever bootloader is
present on the platform. Moreover, AFAIK some platforms bootchain (x86)
are hardly modifiable.
