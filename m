Well, not necessarily.  There is another case where only the userns is
unshared and securityfs is never mounted inside the container.  If the
process has the capability to open the securityfs files (kubernetes
privileged container, say), what should it see? The analogue with the
pid namespace says it should see the contents of the what the parent
had mounted because if it wanted to see its own it would have done a
mount of securityfs inside the userns.  This argues for sb->s_user_ns-
>ima_ns.

for the setns mount namespace case, the vfsmnt tree is duplicated, so
if the securityfs sb->s_user_ns is your user namespace in the prior
mount namespace, it will end up being so in the new one.  sb->s_user_ns 
only changes on actual mount.

Once the userns is unshared, IMA accounting is done inside the
namespace.  However, in order to see the results, the container must
mount securityfs in the userns.  I can't think of a good reason why a
privileged container should want to be accounted separately but see the
results of its parents, but similarly I can't see why a pid namespace
should want to see /proc of its parent either ... yet that's the
semantic we have today.

If you're able to setns to a user namespace, you logically have all its
privileges, so that problem shouldn't arise.

Option 2 is basically sliding back towards securityfs magically
changing properties depending on which userns is asking.  If we're
going to support that, I don't see what was wrong with the owner/guid
magically changing as well like I first propsed.  If we're going to
insist on a new mount of securityfs, I think it has to function cleanly
like the pid namespace, so option 1 is required.
