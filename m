So the problem is that someone could mount securityfs before any
idmappings are setup or what? How does moving the setup to a later stage
help at all? I'm struggling to make sense of this. When or even if
idmappings are written isn't under imas control. Someone could mount
securityfs without any idmappings setup. In that case they should get
what they deserve, everything owner by overflowuid/overflowgid, no? Or
you can require in fill_super that kuid 0 and kgid 0 are mapped and fail
if they aren't.
