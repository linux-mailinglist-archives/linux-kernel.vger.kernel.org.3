IIUC what you are implementing here is a "memory allowance boost"
feature and it seems you are implementing it entirely inside the
kernel, while only userspace knows when to apply this boost (say at
app launch time). This does not make sense to me.

I had exactly the same thought while reading through this.
In Android you would probably need to implement a userspace service
which would temporarily relax the memcg limits when required, monitor
PSI levels and adjust the limits accordingly.
