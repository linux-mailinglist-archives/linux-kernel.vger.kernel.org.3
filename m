Yes. Sorry for replying very late again.

Probably the last fix that you suggest is enough, but I'm a little bit
concerned that it may be a little hasty.  In fact, before this fix, we
exchanged several messages, and I didn't seem to be very good at
convincing you about the need to keep into account also in-service
I/O.  So, my question is: are you sure that now you have a
clear/complete understanding of this non-trivial matter?
Consequently, are we sure that this last fix is most certainly all we
need?  Of course, I will check on my own, but if you reassure me on
this point, I will feel more confident.

Thanks,
Paolo
