Sure, keys on the "machine" keyring can be used to verify the kexec
kernel image signature.

As all of the above requirements is satisfied by loading a root CA, def
ined as a KeySigning cert, without needing to load all of the MOK keys
onto the "machine" keyring, support both trust models.  Please make
loading all MOK keys configurable, with a thorough explanation.
