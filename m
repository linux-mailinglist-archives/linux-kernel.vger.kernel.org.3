One of the reporters uploaded the logs to the kernel.org bugzilla
  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215167

(I forgot to add this URL to the patch description, although this
 could be reached from openSUSE Bugzila entry.)

Let me know (or better to access to bugzilla above by yourself) if
anything else is required.


thanks,

Takashi
