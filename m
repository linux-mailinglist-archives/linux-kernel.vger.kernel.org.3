I didn't mean that you can read the value while it is being changed. I
meant that between writing to memory.reclaim and reading from it,
another reclaim operation could modify memcg vmpressure. A sequence
like this:
1) Write to memory.reclaim
2) Kernel coincidentally runs reclaim on that memcg
3) Read from memory.reclaim

The result would be that you are reading the stats of another reclaim
operation, not the one invoked by writing to memory.reclaim.

IIUC vmpressure is used as an indicator for memory pressure. In my
opinion it makes sense if vmpressure is not changed on reclaim
operations directly invoked by the user, as they are not directly
related to whether the system is under memory pressure or not. PSI is
handled in a similar way. See e22c6ed90aa9 ("mm: memcontrol: don't
count limit-setting reclaim as
memory pressure").

If the main goal is exposing vmpressure, regardless of proactive
reclaim, this is something else. AFAIK vmpressure is not popular
anymore and PSI is the more recent/better indicator.
