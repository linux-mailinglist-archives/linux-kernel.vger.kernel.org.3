Yes, when I first found this problem, I thought that the inode table was 
an abnormal value
when the disk was mounted. However, in ext4_ check_ Descriptors see the 
inspection of inode table.
ext4_ check_ Descriptors is more strict, and it also checks blocks_ 
Bitmap and inode_ bitmap。

However, in addition to mounting, I can't find any changes to 
bg_inode_table_hi  in other parts of
the kernel, which makes me very confused. It wasn't until I tracked the 
address of the variable that
I found it was modified by memcpy.

This check is added here to facilitate us to find problems and avoid 
dead loops. Otherwise,
we may not find problems until the write back process is stuck in the D 
state for several hours.
  At this time, the file system may be in a mess.

Indeed, But is it true that checking for inode_bitmap in 
ext4_read_inode_bitmap and
checking for block_bitmap in ext4_read_block_bitmap_nowait also 
unnecessary?
After all, inode_bitmap and block_bitmap may be faulty only when the 
metadata  is corrupted.
I think it seems unreasonable that both block_bitmap and inode_bitmap 
have checks and inode_table does not.

Totally agree! There is a FIXME in the comments of __getblk_gfp:

` ` `
__getblk_gfp() will lock up the machine if grow_dev_page's
try_to_free_buffers() attempt is failing. FIXME, perhaps?
` ` `

This is the same as this issue because the return value of the 
grow_buffers function is not propagated correctly.

Yes, this function can be called in many places, and external interface 
changes are involved.
