The field, FME_PORT_OFST_BAR_ID, is a three bit field, which is pretty 
common for BARs on PCI.  PCI_STD_NUM_BARS is defined as 6.  Current HW 
implementations are filing this field with the value, 7, which is close to 
the suggestion of 0xff's.  How about we define the following magic 
number?
#define NO_LOCAL_PORT_BAR	7

We should also change the dev_info to be a dev_dbg and more precise to 
something like the following:

 	if (bar == NO_LOCAL_PORT_BAR) {
 		dev_dbg(&pcidev->dev, "No local port BAR space.\n");
 		continue;
 	}
