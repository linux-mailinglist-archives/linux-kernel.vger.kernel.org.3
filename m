Great, I think unrelated details confuse things.

Unless there's a reason *not* to move the DBI accesses for other
variants, I think we should move them all to .post_init().  Otherwise
it's just magic -- there's no indication in the code about why IPQ8074
needs to be different from all the rest.

a0fd361db8e5 appeared in v5.11, so presumably IPQ8074 has been broken
since then?  Are there any problem report URLs or references to the
attempts you mentioned above that we could include here?

Since folks may want to backport the fix to v5.11, I'd probably do
this patch by itself to make the backport easier, then add a second
patch to move the DBI accesses for all the other variants.

My personal opinion is that you should do this based on v5.19-rc1, and
then we can rebase Dmitry's patches on top.  That would make all the
patches simpler and it would make yours easier to backport.  But
that's the sort of thing Dmitry, Stanimir, Andy, and Bjorn A. could
weigh in on.
