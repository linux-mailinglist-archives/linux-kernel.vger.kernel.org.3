Hi,

In our case, the disk is provided by server, and such disk can be shared
by multipul clients. Thus for the client side, the server is a higher
level parent.

Theoretically, limit the io from server for each client is feasible,
however, the main reason we don't want to do this is the following
shortcoming:

client can still send io to server unlimited, we can just limit the
amount of io that can complete from server, which might cause too much
pressure on the server side.

Thanks,
Kuai
