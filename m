Subject: [PATCH v2 2/2] perf vendor events intel: Update event list for Snowridgex

From: Zhengjun Xing <zhengjun.xing@linux.intel.com>

More uncore events are added in the converter tool:

https://github.com/intel/event-converter-for-linux-perf

Keep both alias and the original name for the events, in case someone
already used the alias in their script.

Generate the perf events based on Snowridgex(SNR) event list v1.20:

https://download.01.org/perfmon/SNR/

Signed-off-by: Zhengjun Xing <zhengjun.xing@linux.intel.com>
---
Change log:
  v2:
    * Keep both alias and the original name for the events.
    * update SNR event list from v1.19 to v1.20
