If you're going to take that one, can you perhaps take patches
1-3 for 5.17 through your tree as well (patch 3 depends on 2/it) ?

Note there is a v4 of this series, see please use that :)

I assume the follow up patches are also going to need patch 3
(the actual conversion of the driver to aux-bus).

Here is my Ack for the pdx86 bits in patch 3:

Acked-by: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

And patch 1 and 3 also have acks from the PCI resp. MFD subsys maintainers,
so I guess taking this all upstream through your tree is fine.

That leaves patches 4-6, 4 is the patching adding the new
"Intel Software Defined Silicon driver" sysfs API and I would
like to take some time to thoroughly review the new
userspace API, which I don't see happening before the
Christmas Holidays, so I don't plan to merge 4-6 (which
depends on 3) until after 5.17-rc1.

Regards,

Hans
