Yeah, and I have some reservations with clearing that flag because,
technically speaking, that CPU still has X86_BUG_SRBDS - it's just that
it hasn't been exposed due to TSX being disabled. And no SRBDS microcode
has been uploaded.

Btw this is exactly the reason I want this to be crystal clear -
the insane conditionals around those things just to salvage *some*
performance with a lot of "but but" make everyone who deals with bugs.c
cringe...

Anyway, Pawan's suggestion makes more sense with the aspect that, yes,
the CPU is affected but the MSR is not there. And we already have
similar logic when dealing with TSX so that no new territory.

So yeah, let's do his but *actually* document why and put it in a
separate line:
