This thread is about ima and its stashing of dentries in struct
ima_namespace. That things might be different for other consumers is
uninteresting for this specific case, I think.

That still doesn't require you to take an additional reference on the
dentry per se.
Aside from this brings in a whole different and way bigger issue as that
requires way more fundamental work since this is about a (pseudo or
proper) device. It's not even clear that this should have entries
outside of init_user_ns-securityfs.

I have not heard an argument why ima needs to stash these dentries as it
doesn't remove them once created until umount.
