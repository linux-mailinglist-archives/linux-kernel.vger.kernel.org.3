Instead of hacking this into the binary, couldn't we define a protocol
that the kernel will call from the EFI stub (before EBS()) to identify
itself as an image that understands unaccepted memory, and knows how
to deal with it?

That way, the firmware can accept all the memory on behalf of the OS
at ExitBootServices() time, unless the OS has indicated there is no
need to do so.
