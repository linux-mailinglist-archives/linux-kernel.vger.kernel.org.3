I was suggesting if we can have device tree param like the patch sandeep
pointed out.

How would adding a compatible index to usb_xhci_of_match[] would work
actually? I ask this because, dwc3/host.c creates platform device and
it is not associated with any of_node, so of_driver_match_device() called
from platform bus match method does not work. one way to achieve this would
be by matching against sysdev. Something like below. Is it acceptible?

I cross checked and these are two drivers that are creating xhci-plat device.
So this patch would definitely work. However I am not sure in future if any
device created via device tree would want to use this feature. For now,
it looks good. It Mathias, Do you see any problem with this approach?
