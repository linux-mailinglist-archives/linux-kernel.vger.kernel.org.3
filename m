That's how we've traditionally looked at it, though apparently Red Hat
and SUSE have implemented different ideas of what a long wait time is.

In practice, one minute has always been enough for all of kpatch's users
-- AFAIK, everybody except SUSE -- up until now.

That timeout is not set in stone, and can be extended if needed, either
with "kpatch load" waiting longer, or with it returning immediately and
instead reporting livepatch stalls via WARN().

The latter option is a bigger change in behavior, since any errors will
be delayed and reported in a different way, but if other users are ok
with that, it's fine with me.

Though, these options might be considered workarounds, as it's
theoretically possible for a kthread to be CPU-bound indefinitely,
beyond any arbitrarily chosen timeout.  But maybe that's not realistic
beyond a certain timeout value of X and we don't care?  I dunno.

No, PREEMPT will have the same problem.  Preempting a kthread doesn't
patch it unless the task happens to still be blocked during the next
invocation of klp_transition_work_fn().

You're obviously trying to fix a real world problem.  Whether you call
that issue a bug, or "suboptimal behavior", it's still a problem.

As you said, the kthread is acting within the allowed parameters of how
a kthread should behave.  But "kpatch load" will fail.  That sounds
broken to me.  We need to figure out a way to fix that for all
configs/arches.

As I have been trying to say, that won't work for PREEMPT+!ORC, because,
when the kthread gets preempted, the stack trace will be attempted from
an IRQ and will be reported as unreliable.

Ideally we'd have the ORC unwinder for all arches, that would make this
much easier.  But we're not there yet.
