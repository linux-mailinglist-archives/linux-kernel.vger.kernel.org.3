+Open FPGA Stack
+=====================
+
+Open FPGA Stack (OFS) is a collection of RTL and open source software providing
+interfaces to access the instantiated RTL easily in an FPGA. OFS leverages the
+DFL for the implementation of the FPGA RTL design.
+
+OFS designs allow for the arrangement of software interfaces across multiple
+PCIe endpoints. Some of these interfaces may be PFs defined in the static region
+that connect to interfaces in an IP that is loaded via Partial Reconfiguration (PR).
+And some of these interfaces may be VFs defined in the PR region that can be
+reconfigured by the end-user. Furthermore, these PFs/VFs may use DFLs such that
+features may be discovered and accessed in user space (with the aid of a generic
+kernel driver like vfio-pci). The diagram below depicts an example design with two
+PFs and two VFs. In this example, it will export the management functions via PF0,
+PF1 will bind with virtio-net driver presenting itself as a network interface to
+the OS. The other functions, VF0 and VF1, leverage VFIO to export the MMIO space
+to an application or assign to a VM.

+
+As accelerators are specialized hardware, they are typically limited in the
+number installed in a given system. Many use cases require them to be shared
+across multiple software contexts or threads of software execution, either
+through partitioning of individual dedicated resources, or virtualization of
+shared resources. OFS provides several models to share the AFU resources via
+PR mechanism and hardware-based virtualization schemes.
+
+1. Legacy model.
+   With legacy model FPGA cards like Intel PAC N3000 or N5000, there is
+   a notion that the boundary between the AFU and the shell is also the unit of
+   PR for those FPGA platforms. This model is only able to handle a
+   single context, because it only has one PR engine, and one PR region which
+   has an associated Port device.
+2. Multiple VFs per PR slot.
+   In this model, available AFU resources may allow instantiation of many VFs
+   which have a dedicated PCIe function with their own dedicated MMIO space, or
+   partition a region of MMIO space on a single PCIe function. Intel PAC N6000
+   card has implemented this model.
+   In this model, the AFU/PR slot was not connected to port device. For DFL's view,
+   the Next_AFU pointer in FIU feature header of port device points to NULL in this
+   model, so in AFU driver perspective, there is no AFU MMIO region managed by
+   AFU driver. On the other hand, each VF can start with an AFU feature header without
+   being connected to a FIU Port feature header.
+
+In multiple VFs per PR slot model, the port device can still be accessed using
+ioctls API which expose /dev/dfl-port.h device nodes, like port reset, get
+port info, whose APIs were mentioned in AFU section in this documentation. But
+it cannot access the AFU MMIO space via AFU ioctl APIs like DFL_FPGA_PORT_DMA_MAP
+because there is no AFU MMIO space managed in the AFU driver. Users can access
+the AFU resource by creating VF devices via PCIe SRIOV interface, and then access
+the VF via VFIO driver or assign the VF to VM.
+
+In multiple VFs per PR slot model, the steps to enable VFs are compatible with
+legacy mode which are mentioned in "FPGA virtualization - PCIe SRIOV" section
+in this documentation.
+
+OFS provides the diversity for accessing the AFU resource to RTL developer.
+An IP designer may choose to add more than one PF for interfacing with IP
+on the FPGA and choose different model to access the AFU resource.
+
+There is one reference architecture design using the "Multiple VFs per PR slot"
+model for OFS as illustrated below. In this reference design, it exports the
+FPGA management functions via PF0. PF1 will bind with virtio-net driver
+presenting itself as a network interface to the OS. PF2 will bind to the
+vfio-pci driver allowing the user space software to discover and interface
+with the specific workload like diagnostic test. To access the AFU resource,
+it uses SR-IOV to partition workload interfaces across various VFs.
