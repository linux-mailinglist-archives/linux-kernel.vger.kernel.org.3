One thing which just occured to me and I missed so far is the
association of the irqdomain.

Right now we know for each device which irqdomain it belongs to. That's
part of device discovery (PCI, device tree or whatever) which set's up

     device->irqdomain

That obviously cannot work for that device specific IMS domain. Why?

Because the PCIe device provides MSI[x] which obviously requires that
device->irqdomain is pointing to the PCI/MSI irqdomain. Otherwise the
PCI/MSI allocation mechanism wont work.

Sure each driver can have

     mystruct->ims_irqdomain

and then do the allocation via

    msi_irq_domain_alloc(mystruct->ims_irqdomain....)

but I really need to look at all of the MSI infrastructure code whether
it makes assumptions about this:

   msi_desc->dev->irqdomain

being the correct one. Which would obviously just be correct when we'd
have a per queue struct device :)

It's a per lfunc xarray, yes.

Ok. I prefer the term indexed storage, but yeah.

The timer device would be represented by what? A struct device?

If so then something needs to set device->irqdomain and then you can
just do:

     msi_irq_domain_alloc_irqs(dev->irqdomain, dev, ...);

It does not have to when it's struct device based.

To do that, I need to understand the bigger picture and the intended
usage because otherwise we end up with an utter mess.

Really?

If there is a hardwired entry then this hardwired entry belongs to the
controlblock (status, error or whatever), but certainly not to a
dynamically allocatable queue as that would defeat the whole purpose.

That hardwired entry could surely exist in a IDXD type setup where the
message storage is in an defined array on the device.

But with the use case you described where you store the message at some
place in per queue system memory, the MSI index is not relevant at all,
because there is no table. So it's completely meaningless for the device
and just useful for finding the related MSI descriptor again.

If the queue or the controlblock have an internal small array of
messages in their queue or controlblock specific memory, then how would
a per device global index help?

Or has each queue and controlblock and whatever access to a shared large
array where the messages are stored and the indices are handed out to
the queues and controlblocks?

If each of them have their own small array, then queue relative indexing
makes a ton of sense, no?

I'm aware of that.

The IRQ layer _has_ to worry about it because there is a strict
relationship between device and irqdomain today.

Now with a PCIe device having PCI/MSI[X] it's a strict 1:1
relationship. Now add IMS to the picture and we end up with a 1:2
relationship, which does not work today.

That's why my initial reaction was to partition the device into
subdevices which would have solved the problem nicely.

That would mean that the PCI device would not use MSI-X at all, right?
So it could have pci_dev.dev.irqdomain = IMSdomain.

But that sucks too because it's yet another quirk as the PCIe discovery
cannot set that up simply because the device specific IMS domain does
not exist yet.

> Is it helpful feedback?

Yes, definitely. It helps me to understand the bigger picture and to
find a proper representation of these things so that we don't end up
with the usual mess in drivers/* which makes it a fricking nightmare to
change anything at the core code at all.
