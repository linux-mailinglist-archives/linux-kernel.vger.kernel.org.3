So I maybe missed something when implementing the usage of journal_heads
under RCU but let's have a look. An example of RCU user of journal heads
is fs/jbd2/transaction.c:jbd2_write_access_granted(). It does:

        rcu_read_lock();

	// This part fetches journal_head from buffer_head - not related to
	// our slab RCU discussion

        if (!buffer_jbd(bh))
                goto out;
        /* This should be bh2jh() but that doesn't work with inline functions */
        jh = READ_ONCE(bh->b_private);
        if (!jh)
                goto out;

	// The validation comes here

        /* For undo access buffer must have data copied */
        if (undo && !jh->b_committed_data)
                goto out;
        if (READ_ONCE(jh->b_transaction) != handle->h_transaction &&
            READ_ONCE(jh->b_next_transaction) != handle->h_transaction)
                goto out;
	
	// Then some more checks unrelated to the slab itself.

        /*
         * There are two reasons for the barrier here:
         * 1) Make sure to fetch b_bh after we did previous checks so that we
         * detect when jh went through free, realloc, attach to transaction
         * while we were checking. Paired with implicit barrier in that path.
         * 2) So that access to bh done after jbd2_write_access_granted()
         * doesn't get reordered and see inconsistent state of concurrent
         * do_get_write_access().
         */
        smp_mb();
        if (unlikely(jh->b_bh != bh))
                goto out;

	// If all passed

	rcu_read_unlock();
	return true;

So if we are going to return true from the function, we know that 'jh' was
attached to handle->h_transaction at some point. And when 'jh' was attached
to handle->h_transaction, the transaction was holding reference to the 'jh'
and our 'handle' holds reference to the transaction so 'jh' could not be
freed since that moment. I.e., we are sure our reference to the handle keeps
'jh' alive and we can safely use it.

I don't see how any amount of scribbling over 'jh' could break this
validation. But maybe it is just a lack of my imagination :).
