Please don't top post.

And you don't have to clean too much context, otherwise people have to
search previous mails to remember what is it. People may not read the
mail at once.

But you are adding the logic in altera_cvp_write() to keep the
correctness. What's the difference adding it somewhere else? And as I
can see, preventing the writing at the very beginning is a much cleaner
way.

So if the image size is not aligned to 1 Page, the reprogram should fail
anyway, is it? Then I really recommend you fail the reprogramming at the
very beginning.

I don't think so. We should make the code reasonable. Blindly copy the
whole buffer impacts all normal cases, and makes people confused. The
code seems shorter now, but not simpler, it takes people more time to
figure out why.

I meant moving it to altera_cvp_write_init(). But now I think it is not
necessary. Bouncing buffer is not necessary at all.
