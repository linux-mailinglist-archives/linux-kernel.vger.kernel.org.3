Crazy like a fox.

Yes. I am looking into it.

My reasons for attempting the DWARF based implementation:

- My implementation is largely architecture independent. There are a couple of
  minor pieces that are architecture-specific, but they are minor in nature.
  So, if an architecture wanted to support the livepatch feature but did not
  want to do a heavy weight objtool implementation, then it has an option.
  There has been some debate about whether static analysis should be mandated
  for livepatch. My patch series is an attempt to provide an option.

- To get an objtool static analysis implementation working for an architecture
  as reliably as X64 and getting it reviewed and upstreamed can take years. It took
  years for X64, am I right? I mean, it has been quite a while since the original
  patch series for arm64 was posted. There have been only one or two minor comments
  so far. I am sure arm64 linux users would very much want to have livepatch available
  ASAP to be able to install security fixes without downtime. This is an immediate need.

- No software is bug free. So, even if static analysis is implemented for an architecture,
  it would be good to have another method of verifying the unwind rules generated from
  the static analysis. DWARF can provide that additional verification.
