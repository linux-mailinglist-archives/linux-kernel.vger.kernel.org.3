May I ask what the purpose of this exercise is? So if I understand
correctly, then it's about to convert the sun8i-a23-prcm MFD driver and
its children to a single "modern style" CCU clock driver, with its opaque
DT node?
If that changes the compatible strings or the references to the clock
providers (and I guess it would need to?), then this would mean an
incompatible change. Which also means we would need to keep the old code
around, to maintain compatibility with "old" DTs? So what is the win then?
Now we have *two* clock drivers, for the same device, which need
maintenance and testing.

So can you confirm that this will be a breaking change?

This aims for a similar direction, though in this case the alternative
(PSCI) predates the sunxi specific method in the kernel support. Can we
just deprecate this code, maybe issue a warning, with the hint to update
the bootloader (which might not be possible for some devices)?

Cheers,
Andre
