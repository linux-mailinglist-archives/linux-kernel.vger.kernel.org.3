Hi, Jan

Our case is modifing a no-empty file names "data.conf" through vim, it will
cp "data.conf" to ".data.conf.swp" firstly, overwrite rename ".data.conf.swp"
back to "data.conf" and fsync after modifying. If we power down between rename
and fsync, we may lose all data in the original "data.conf" and get a whole
zero file. Before we enable dioread_nolock by defalut, the newly appending data
may lost, but at least we will not lose the original data in the default
data=ordered and auto_da_alloc mode. It seems that dioread_nolock breaks the
guarantee provide by auto_da_alloc. Maybe we should add a fsync before rename
in vim ?

Thanks,
Yi.
