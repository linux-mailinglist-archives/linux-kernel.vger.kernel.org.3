Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

@kernel developers: you might want to consider ignoring this, the
reporter provided additional information in the ticket and it looks a
lot like it's not a regression. For details see:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215906#c4

Sorry for the noise.

Ciao, Thorsten
