Had some delays in replying,from the perspective of the driver, 
Intel architects want it to be just purely on the transfer of 
data without inspecting the data. 
If the size of a transfer is 4096bytes, we can padd it. 
I can do that which I think it is not an issue.
Let me create a reworked patch to pad the payload with Zeros.
Would this be OK for patch v3?

Reply as above, let us implement the padding in the
next patch v3. Appreciate your inputs. Thanks
