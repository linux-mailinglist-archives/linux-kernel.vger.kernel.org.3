True the problem currently exists with the builtin keys, but there's a
major difference between trusting the builtin keys and those being
loading via MOK.  This is an integrity gap that needs to be closed and
shouldn't be expanded to keys on the .machine keyring.

"plus it would allow IMA to work with non-CA keys" is unacceptable.
