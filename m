Then assume boards are not really compatible, bump rev to rev8 and ship
it. Bootloader will know it is rev8 and use it.

Everything looks fine then. You have a rev8 board, which is not
compatible with rev7, and bootloader looks for rev8. Finds it (since it
is physically there!), loads it.

You have a rev7 board so bootloader looks for rev7, finds it and loads it.

Sure, let's skip fallbacks and assume everything is not compatible with
else.

Yes, but booting it does not mean that the hardware is rev3 or rev4.
Booting it means only that we are running DTB on a compatible hardware.
The DTB determines what is accessible to user-space, not what *really*
the hardware is. The user-space (since we are going now to original
question) reads it and can understand that it is running on hardware
compatible with rev3 - either rev3 or rev4 - and act accordingly.

No, providing and loading a rev4 DTB on a rev3 board is not correct and
does not make any sense. rev3 boards are not compatible with rev4, it's
the other way. Not every fruit is an apple, but every apple is a fruit.
This is why I used that example - if you load rev4 DTB on rev3 hardware
then you have totally wrong booting process.
