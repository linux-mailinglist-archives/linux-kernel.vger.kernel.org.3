Hi, Paolo

bfq_weights_tree_remove() will be called when all requests are completed
in bfq_queue, thus I recored how many queues have pending requests
through weights tree insertion and removal.(Details in patch 7)

Thus when calling bfq_weights_tree_remove() for bfqq, I can check if
there are no queues have pending requests for parent bfqg:

if (!bfqg->num_entities_with_pending_reqs && -> no queues with pending reqs
     entity->in_groups_with_pending_reqs) {   -> the group is counted

Thanks,
Kuai
