Hi Rajvi,

I received your v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 postings because they were sent
directly to bhelgaas@google.com, but for some reason vger doesn't like
them so they don't show up on the mailing list:

  https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=a%3Arajvi.jingar

I looked at the ones I received directly and don't see an obvious
problem.  Maybe there's a hint here?

  http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html

All patches should appear on the linux-pci mailing list before
applying them, so we need to figure this out somehow.  In fact, I read
and review patches from linux-pci, so I often don't even see things
that are just sent directly to bhelgaas@google.com.

I think the paragraph above is a distraction, and the real reason is
the paragraph below.

I think the argument for disabling PTM is that:

  - If a PTM Requester is put in a low-power state, a PTM Responder
    upstream from it may also be put in a low-power state.

  - Putting a Port in D1, D2, or D3hot does not prohibit it from
    sending or responding to PTM Requests (I'd be glad to be corrected
    about this).

  - We want to disable PTM on Responders when they are in a low-power
    state.

  - Per 6.21.3, a PTM Requester must not be enabled when the upstream
    PTM Responder is disabled.

  - Therefore, we must disable all PTM on all downstream PTM
    Requesters before disabling it on the PTM Responder, e.g., a Root
    Port.

This has nothing specifically to do with Coffee Lake or other Intel
chips, so I think the comment should be merely something to the
effect that "disabling PTM reduces power consumption."

It makes sense to me that we needn't disable PTM if the device is in
D3cold.  But the "!dev_state_saved" condition depends on what the
driver did.  Why is that important?  Why should we not do the
following?

  if (pci_dev->current_state != PCI_D3cold)
    pci_disable_ptm(pci_dev);
