So read again what you have presented in the past, in the email to which
you have referenced. I sent link to that your email in previous email.

Or you absolutely incompetent and I should have remind also previous
email to which you wrote your reaction?

No, just pure reality of your behavior of what you are doing and what
you are saying.

I do not think. You personally, have presented this statement, and I'm
just reminding it to you like you have asked for it.

You are doing it for more than one year. Are you happy with it? Seem
absolutely.

> Just stop Cc'ing me on your patches

As there no progress from your side, nor change of your behavior from
more than one year, I'm accepting this offer.

This is my last email to you and I'm stopping right now to read your
emails.

I'm not obligated to remind you everything what you are asking just
because you are lazy to find you what you have wrote in the past.
