Dear Andrew Morton,

I am trying to get my taskstats updates noticed since 2018 now. Balbir
Singh does not seem to be active/responding at the mail address that

	scripts/get_maintainer.pl kernel/taskstats.c

produces. The guide at

	https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html

suggests that I should bother you directly in that case. May I kindly
point to the two patches that I'd like to have reviewed and hopefully
included?

These are the two patches in the LKML archive:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/1/10/1136
https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/1/10/1135

I hope they are trivial enough, in the end.


Alrighty then,

Thomas
