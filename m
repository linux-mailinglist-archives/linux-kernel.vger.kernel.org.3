Thanks for patient explanation. Now I got your point.

Instead of avoiding updating local per-cpu counters for reparented pages,
after reparenting, how about propagating the child memcg's local per-cpu
counters to its parent after LRU pages reparenting? And we do not need to
propagate all vmstats, just some vmstats exposed to cgroup v1 users (like
memcg1_stats, memcg1_events and lru list pages). I think a reparented page
is just a little bit of difference compared to other non-reparented pages,
propagating local per-cpu counters may be acceptable. What do you think?
