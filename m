I assume the post-S3 path is basically this:

  pci_pm_resume_noirq
    pci_pm_default_resume_early
      pci_power_up
        pci_raw_set_power_state(D0)
          pcie_aspm_pm_state_change
            pcie_config_aspm_path
              pcie_config_aspm_link
                pcie_config_aspm_l1ss
                  clear PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_ASPM_L1 etc
                  set PCI_L1SS_CTL1_ASPM_L1_1 etc
                pcie_config_aspm_dev
                  set PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_ASPM_L1 etc
      pci_restore_state
        pci_restore_ltr_state
        pci_restore_aspm_l1ss_state     # after this patch
        pci_restore_pcie_state

Hmm...  I think I see what you're saying.  pcie_aspm_pm_state_change()
fiddles with ASPM and L1SS enable bits.  It likely disables L1,
enables L1SS, enables L1, but never restores the LTR capability or the
T_PwrOn and LTR1.2_Threshold bits you mention.

Then we turn around and overwrite all that stuff (and the LTR cap) in
pci_restore_state().  That all seems fairly broken, and I agree, I
don't know why pcie_aspm_pm_state_change() exists.

This would update T_PwrOn and LTR1.2_Threshold, so I guess it makes
sense that this would help.  But I think we need to figure out the
reason why pcie_aspm_pm_state_change() exists and get rid of it or at
least better integrate it with pci_restore_state().

If we call pcie_aspm_pm_state_change() after D3cold or reset, things
still aren't going to work because the LTR cap isn't restored or
programmed.
