This merely means that the current unintended behavior of userspace USR1 
signals must not be changed.  But it doesn't mean you have to continue 
to rely on that behavior; you can implement something better.

Why is this?  A lot of actual devices (DVD drives, for instance) don't 
give you the ability to eject the media when the host has prevented it.  
Why should f-mass-storage be different?

Okay.  But what about the 30-second host timeout I mentioned above?  
Does this actually happen with your approach?  It seems like the kind of 
thing you don't want in a "turn it off immediately" situation.  (I 
haven't tried doing this myself -- maybe I should.)

It sounds like what you really want is a combination of both "interrupt 
I/O" and "forced eject".

In fact, the best approach would be to introduce a new state (let's call 
it FSG_STATE_FORCED_EJECT) with priority just above
FSG_STATE_ABORT_BULK_OUT.  You would call raise_exception with 
FSG_STATE_FORCED_EJECT, not FSG_STATE_NORMAL.  handle_exceptions() would 
treat this state partially like ABORT_BULK_OUT in that it would avoid 
resetting all the LUN data values and would call send_status_common() if 
a command had been underway.  But in addition it would do the forced 
eject.

Also, the sysfs routine should be careful to see whether the command 
currently being executed is for the LUN being ejected.  I guess you 
have never tried issuing your USR1 signal to a mass-storage gadget 
running more than one LUN.  If you did, you would find that it clears 
the prevent_medium_removal flag for all of them, not just the one that 
you wanted.
