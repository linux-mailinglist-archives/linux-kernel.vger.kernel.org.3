IMO, the per-cpu forced idle time can help us get to know whether the
forced idle time is uniform among the core, or among all the cpus. IMO,
it's a kind of balance.

If cgroup accounting patch is merged, this patch is still needed.

Consider the following scenario:
Task p of cgroup A is running on cpu x, and it forces cpu y into idle
for t ns. The forceidle time of cgroup A on cpu x increases t ns, and
the forcedidle time of cpu y increases t ns.

That is, the force idle time of cgroup is defined as the forced idle
time it caused, and the force idle time of cpu is defined as the time
the cpu is forced into idle, which have different meanings from each other.

And for SMT > 2, we cannot caculate the forced idle time of cpu x from
the cgroup interface.

Best,
Cruz Zhao
