OK, so even after you implement INTx for the emulated Root Ports, the
default of_irq_parse_and_map_pci() is insufficient, and you will
require an mvebu .map_irq() function.  That's reasonable.

"PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN == 0" is the way software learns that a device
doesn't use INTx, of course, and I suppose PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN already
reads as zero, since mvebu_pci_bridge_emul_init() doesn't set
bridge->conf.intpin, and I assume the default value would be zero?
