Thanks a lot for suggesting this, it indeed looks very much cleaner.

I will make sure to document the interface properly as suggested in v2.

I think we would still need a system-level interface anyway for
systems with no memcg that wish to make use of proactive memory
reclaim. We can still make the memory.reclaim interface available for
root as well if you think this is desirable.
