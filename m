While right now only my poking around the early init via alternatives
is affected, the problem exists for everyone.

I.e. I do consider flush_icache_all() to be generic enough that we
should expect someone trying to call this in some early code-path
as well.

But any call to flush_icache_all() before sbi_init() ran will cause the
breakage that is fixed by patch1 .


So it doesn't look like any _current_ code path has that issue, but
it might be good to just pick patch1 for the next merge window
individually?

Yeah, we now depend on Atish's isa-extension parsing (same for my cmo
series and some more series I saw on the list), so getting that into a
mergeable position would be really great :-)

"attempt to move .org backwards" seems to be the telltale sign of the
alternatives blocks not matching up in size. While I definitly didn't see
anything like this in my tests on qemu + d1, I'll try to investigate where
that comes from.
