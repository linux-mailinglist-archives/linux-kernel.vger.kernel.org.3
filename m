I'm going to go take a lighter touch with this round of reviews.
First, because I have February off. :)
Second, because I think that someone who is more familiar with IMA and
its requirements should take another look to provide input and ask more
questions. Last time I spoke to Serge he did want to give this a longer
look and maybe also has additional questions.
