I do not have direct claims that some node really reached this limit,
however I saw crashdumps with 30000+ cgroups.

Theoretically OpenVz/LXC nodes can host up to several thousand containers
per node. Practically production nodes with 300-400 containers are a
common thing. I assume that each container can easily use up to 100-200
memory cgroups, and I think this is normal consumption.

Therefore, I believe that 64K limit is quite achievable in real life.
Primary goal of my patch is to confirm this theory.

For my goal (i.e. just to confirm that 64K limit was reached) this
functionality is too complicated. This confirmation is important because
it should push us to increase the global limit.

However, I think your idea is great, In perspective it helps both OpenVZ
and LXC and possibly Shakeel to understand the real memcg using and set
the proper limit for containers. 

I'm going to prepare such patches, however I'm not sure I'll have enough
time for this task in the near future.

Thank you,
