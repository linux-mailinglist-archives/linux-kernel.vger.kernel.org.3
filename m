Hello! I think that this PCI SMC could be already marked as deprecated
as Linux can use "native" drivers to access PCIe config space, without
need to use any kind of RPC mechanism, like ARM SMC.

Note that for example kernel driver phy-mvebu-a3700-comphy.c was
converted from ARM SMC API to true "native" linux driver which touch
hardware directly (and does not use RPC API). And this is the right
direction, stop using RPC APIs in kernel and configure hardware
directly without need to depends on firmware, SMC or any other SW which
is running on CPU. Depending on the firmware or its functionality which
access same HW as kernel itself, is always nightmare. x86 developers
have enough experience with BIOS and its poor implementations and there
was for a long time direction to not use x86 BIOS and rather communicate
with hardware directly. And if PCIe hardware is broken? Well, PCIe
controller drivers should be extended to handle or workaround it. I have
already sent lot of patches for Marvell PCIe controllers to workaround
HW design issues, so similarly it should be done for other (known
broken) vendor HW.

So in my opinion, instead of PCI SMC, kernel PCIe controller drivers
should be fixed to correctly access PCIe config space and completely
deprecate/remove this PCI SMC from kernel. And if PCI SMC has not landed
in kernel yet, even better, because deprecation step can be skipped.
