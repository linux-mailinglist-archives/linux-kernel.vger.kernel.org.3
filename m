OK, so do we have any realistic options for identifying the correct PCI 
devices, if USB4 PCIe adapters might be anywhere relative to their 
associated NHI? Short of maintaining a list of known IDs, the only 
thought I have left is that if we walk the whole PCI segment looking 
specifically for hotplug-capable Gen1 ports, any system modern enough to 
have Thunderbolt is *probably* not going to have any real PCIe Gen1 
hotplug slots, so maybe false negatives might be tolerable, but it still 
feels like a bit of a sketchy heuristic.

I suppose we could just look to see if any device anywhere is marked as 
external-facing, and hope that if firmware's done that much then it's 
done everything right. That's still at least slightly better than what 
we have today, but AFAICS still carries significant risk of a false 
positive for an add-in card that firmware didn't recognise.

I'm satisfied that we've come round to the right conclusion on the DMAR 
opt-in - I'm in the middle or writing up patches for that now - but even 
Microsoft's spec gives that as a separate requirement from the flagging 
of external ports, with both being necessary for Kernel DMA Protection.

Robin.
