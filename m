In terms of Android specific scenarios, I think it is not the best
choice to have AMS relax memory allowance directly when activity
arised, as:
1. AMS also has to face latency issues like LMKD does when polling
systems PSI value
2. AMS needs to launch syscalls to act.  A read for either
memcg.usage/watermark and a write on memcg.min/low.
3. Processes in CACHED adj are not capable of shrinking themselves
except waiting to be killed by LMKD.

IMO, this patch is alike an Pressure Aware Per Process Reclaim which
does NOT launch real reclaiming.
