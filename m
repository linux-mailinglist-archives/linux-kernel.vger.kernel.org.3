Hm. You are talking about missed opportunities, but do you know any
workload that would measurably benefit from the change?

The changes are not trivial. And rmap code is complex enough as it is.

I expect common cases to get slower due to additional checks that do not
result in more merges. I donno, the effort looks dubious to me as of now.
