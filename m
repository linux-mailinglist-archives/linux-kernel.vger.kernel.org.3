Sorry for joining late.
A couple years ago I tested root-memcg vs per-app memcg configurations
on an Android phone. Here is a snapshot from my findings:

Problem
=======
We see tangible increase in major faults and workingset refaults when
transitioning from root-only memory cgroup to per-application cgroups
on Android.

Test results
============
Results while running memory-demanding workload:
root memcg     per-app memcg     delta

Results while running application cycle test (20 apps, 20 cycles):

Tests were conducted on an Android phone with 4GB RAM.
Similar regression was reported a couple years ago here:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mm/msg121665.html

I plan on checking the difference again on newer kernels (likely 5.15)
after LPC this September.

We intend for Android to gradually migrate to v2 cgroups for all
controllers and given that it has to use a unified hierarchy,
per-application hierarchy provides highest flexibility. That way we
can control every aspect of every app without affecting others. Of
course that comes with its overhead.
