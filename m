I mean, the mechanism now is simple and doesn't fail. What you're
suggesting is more complex and fails sometimes. So,

so, I think it's beyond a matter of opinion and is actually objectively
worse.

And it's not like I even care particularly much about vnsprintf; as I
said before, none of this really matters _that_ much. But I *do* very
much object to dirtying up random bits of code and making things
actually worse in the name of RT, especially when there are other
solutions being considered. Namely:

I really am having trouble fashioning a test that shows a higher maximum
latency. All the RNG critical sections are really short in the end. So I
dunno... seems like not a big deal to me. If you're seeing different
numbers, can you post them and how you came up with them? If I can
reproduce it, maybe it's possible for me to do something about that
latency. But so far I'm not seeing any latency spike...
