It sounds like either there's a bug or else you're not doing the right 
thing.  Tell me exactly what you do when this fails.

The basic idea is right.  But this should not be a CONFIGFS option; it 
should be an ordinary LUN attribute.  For an example, see the definition of 
file_store() in f_mass_storage.c; your routine should look very similar.
