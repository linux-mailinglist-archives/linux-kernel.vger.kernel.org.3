Yes, I am for the simplicity and this really looks like a bare minumum
interface. But it is not really clear who do you want to add flags on
top of it?

I am not really sure we really need a node aware interface for memcg.
The global reclaim interface will likely need a different node because
we do not want to make this CONFIG_MEMCG constrained.

All that being said. I haven't been a great fan for explicit reclaim
triggered from the userspace but I do recognize that limitations of the 
existing interfaces is just too restrictive.
