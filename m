Subject: Unable to transfer big files to Nokia N9

Dear Linux folks,


For the first time, I wanted to transfer a 2 MB PDF file from a Dell 
Latitude E7250 with Debian sid/unstable with Linux 5.16-rc1 to a Nokia 
N9 (MeeGo/Harmattan). Using the package *bluez-obexd* 5.61-1 and GNOME 
41, the device was found, and paired fine. Then I selected to transfer 
the 2 MB file, and after starting for a second, it timed out after the 
progress bar moves forward ones and failed.

The systemd journal contains:

     obexd[21139]: Transfer(0x56243fe4f790) Error: Timed out waiting for 
response

Testing with a a 5 byte test text file, worked fine. Also testing with a 
Galaly M32, both files were transferred without problems (though slowly 
with 32 KB/s.)

Trying to connect to the device with bluetoothctl failed for me, and the 
journal contained, it failed.

     $ bluetoothctl
     Agent registered
     [bluetooth]# connect 40:98:4E:5B:CE:XX
     Attempting to connect to 40:98:4E:5B:CE:XX
     Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed

     bluetoothd[21104]: src/service.c:btd_service_connect() a2dp-source 
profile connect failed for 40:98:4E:5B:CE:B3: Protocol not available

As the Nokia N9 was once pretty popular in the Linux community, I am 
pretty sure, it used to work fine in the past, and there is some 
regression. Itâ€™d be great, if you could give me some hints how to 
further debug the issue.


Kind regards,

Paul
