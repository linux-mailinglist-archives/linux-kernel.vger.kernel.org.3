What is the semantic of this limit?

Too many cgroups can certainly have a high memory footprint. I guess
this is quite clear. The question is whether trying to limit them by the
memory footprint is really the right way to go. I would be especially
worried about those smaller machines because of a smaller footprint
which would allow to deplete the id space faster.

Maybe we need some sort of limit on the number of cgroups in a subtree
so that any potential runaway can be prevented regardless of the cgroups
memory footprint. One potentially big problem with that is that cgroups
can live quite long after being offlined (e.g. memcg) so such a limit
could easily trigger I can imagine.
