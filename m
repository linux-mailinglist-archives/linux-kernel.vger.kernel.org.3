A full bisect run, as suspected in other messages, results in

    xhci: Fix command ring pointer corruption while aborting a command
    
    commit ff0e50d3564f33b7f4b35cadeabd951d66cfc570 upstream.
    
    The command ring pointer is located at [6:63] bits of the command
    ring control register (CRCR). All the control bits like command
stop,
    abort are located at [0:3] bits. While aborting a command, we read
the
    CRCR and set the abort bit and write to the CRCR. The read will
always
    give command ring pointer as all zeros. So we essentially write
only
    the control bits. Since we split the 64 bit write into two 32 bit
writes,
    there is a possibility of xHC command ring stopped before the upper
    dword (all zeros) is written. If that happens, xHC updates the
upper
    dword of its internal command ring pointer with all zeros. Next
time,
    when the command ring is restarted, we see xHC memory access
failures.
    Fix this issue by only writing to the lower dword of CRCR where all
    control bits are located.

I will try the patch linked by Matias as soon as the openSUSE kernel
build is complete.

Thanks,
Robert
