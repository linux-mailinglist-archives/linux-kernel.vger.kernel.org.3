Hi Tom,

These are very good questions, and the answers will be addressed in the 
documentation associated with a v2 submission of this patch.

If the PCI PID/VID is generic, indicating only that there is one or more 
DFL, then some other mechanism must be used to differentiate the cards. 
One could use unique PCI sub-PID/sub-VIDs to differentiate specific 
implementations.  One could also use some register in BAR space to help 
identify the card, or one could use PCI Vital Product Data (VPD) to 
provide detailed information about the running FPGA design on the card.

This problem exists with the N3000 cards.  Depending on the FPGA 
configuration, the line side of the card could be very different (e.g. 
4x10Gb or 2x2x25Gb).  The network operator must make sure to update a 
particular N3000 card with the correct FPGA image type.  In the case of 
the N3000 there is a register exposed through sysfs containing the 
"Bitstream ID" which contains the line side configuration of the FPGA.

If you only wanted to use lspci to determine the card, then 
differentiating PCI sub-VID/sub-PID could be used or VPD could be used.

The dfl-pci driver is fairly generic in that it doesn't really care about 
the PCI PID/VID because all it really does enumerate the DFLs.  It is the 
individual dfl drivers that may need to know hw differences/bugs for that 
component IP.
