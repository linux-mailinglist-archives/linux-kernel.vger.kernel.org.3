Oh yeah, I noticed that in the commit log, but I think it really warrants an
inline comment.

I don't have too strong an opinion. It just felt a bit disproportionate for
it to be sticking out like that. Maybe toning it down a little bit would
help?

Maybe we just need an rcu_read_lock_held() - does that cover irq being
disabled? I'm not sure what the rules are since the different rcu variants
got merged. Anyways, the right thing to do would be asserting and
documenting that the section is RCU protected.

As for llist not having rcu iterators. The llists aren't RCU protected or
assigned. What's RCU protected is the lifetime of the elements. That said,
we'd need an rmb after fetching llist_head to guarantee that the flusher
sees all the updates which took place before the node got added to the
llist, right?

Can you also add an explanation on how the pending llist is synchronized
against blkg destructions?

Thanks.
