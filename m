+Intel Open FPGA stack
+=====================
+Intel Open FPGA stack aka IOFS, Intel's version of a common core set of
+RTL to allow customers to easily interface to logic and IP on the FPGA.
+IOFS leverage the DFL for the implementation of the FPGA RTL design.
+
+IOFS designs allow for the arrangement of software interfaces across multiple
+PCIe endpoints. Some of these interfaces may be PFs defined in the static region
+that connect to interfaces in an IP that is loaded via Partial Reconfiguration (PR).
+And some of these interfaces may be VFs defined in the PR region that can be
+reconfigured by the end-user. Furthermore, these PFs/VFs may also be arranged
+using a DFL such that features may be discovered and accessed in user space
+(with the aid of a generic kernel driver like vfio-pci). The diagram below depicts
+an example design with two PFs and two VFs. In this example, PF1 implements its
+MMIO space such that it is compatible with the VirtIO framework. The other functions,
+VF0 and VF1, leverage VFIO to export the MMIO space to an application or a hypervisor.

+On IOFS, it introducing some enhancements compared with original DFL design.
+1. It introducing Port Gasket in PF0 which is responsible for FPGA management,
+like FME and Port management. The Port Gasket contains all the PR specific modules
+and logic, e.g., PR slot reset/freeze control, user clock, remote STP etc.
+Architecturally, a Port Gasket can have multiple PR slots where user workload can
+be programmed into.
+2. To expend the scalable of FPGA, it can support multiple FPs in static region
+which contain some static functions like VirtIO, diagnostic test, and access over
+VFIO or assigned to VMs easily. Those PFs will not have a Port Unit which without
+PR region (AFU) connected to those PFs, and the end-user cannot partial reconfigurate
+those PFs.
+3. In our previous DFL design, it can only create one VF based in an AFU. To raise
+the efficiency usage of AFU, it can create more than one VFs in an AFU via PCIe
+SRIOV, so those VFs share the PR region and resource.
+
+There is one reference architecture design for IOFS as illustrated below:

+
+Here are the major changes about DFL structures on IOFS implementation design:
+1. The Port Gasket connects to FIU Port in DFL, but the Next_AFU pointer in
+FIU feature header can point to NULL so that it is no AFU connects to a FIU
+Port.
+2. The VF which include in PR region can start with AFU feature header without
+a FIU Port feature header.
