Good morning sir,

How is business and did you get my previous message?
Some products required by our company were recently found to be cheaper in your country.
Most importantly, I want to use the opportunity to introduce you to our company board of directors, to enable you supply these products to our company, with very good profits.
Also send me your company official website and products catalog, to enable me specify the required product and quantity needed.
Kindly respond back with your direct telephone number, for details.

Best Regards,
Procurement, GCAP Supplies.
