Sorry for being dense here, I think it's finally sinking in.

The problem is that making PCIBIOS_MIN_IO greater than zero would keep
us from assigning a [io 0x0000- ] window, so instead of 16 I/O bridge
windows, we could only have 15 (unless bridges support 32-bit I/O
windows).  Right?

Are you running into that limit?  Most devices don't need I/O port
space, and almost all other arches define PCIBIOS_MIN_IO, so they live
without that window today.

Sparc uses the MMIO I/O port address directly in the struct resource,
so it will never try to allocate [io 0x0000], and there's no problem
with using PCI I/O port 0:

  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x804000000000-0x80400fffffff] (bus address [0x0000-0xfffffff])
  mpt2sas0: ioport(0x0000804000001000), size(256)

The sparc ioport interfaces are basically:

  ioport_map(port)  { return port; }
  ioread8(addr)     { return readb(addr); }
  inb(addr)         { return readb(addr); }

RISC-V uses the generic ones, i.e.,

  ioport_map(port)  { return PIO_OFFSET + port; }
  ioread8(addr)     { if (addr) >= PIO_RESERVED)
                        return readb(addr);
                      else
                        return inb(addr & PIO_MASK); }
  inb(addr)         { return __raw_readb(PCI_IOBASE + addr); }

Obviously RISC-V gives you prettier I/O port addresses, but at the
cost of having PCI I/O port 0 be 0 in the struct resource as well,
which makes it basically unusable.  Is it worth it?
