I really don't understand why you want a cluster PM event generated by
the idle driver. Specially considering that you are not after a
*cluster* PM event, but after some sort of system-wide event (last man
standing).

It looks to me that having a predicate that can be called from a PM
notifier event to find out whether you're the last in line would be
better suited, and could further be used to remove the crap from the
rpmh-rsc driver.
