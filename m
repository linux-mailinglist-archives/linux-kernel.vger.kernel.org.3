With your change you get one dget() from lookup_one_len() in
securityfs_create_dentry() for non-init_ima_ns. That's added to the
dcache via d_instantiate().
If you call securityfs_dentry_remove() in the error path or anywhere
else it does:

	dir = d_inode(dentry->d_parent);
	inode_lock(dir);
	if (simple_positive(dentry)) {
		if (d_is_dir(dentry))
			simple_rmdir(dir, dentry);
		else
			simple_unlink(dir, dentry);
		dput(dentry);
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That dput() right there is for the additional dget() in
securityfs_create_dentry() but we didn't take that. So the dput() is one
too many now since simple_rmdir() and simple_unlink() will have consumed
one already. (You should be able to easily see this if you compile with
sanitizers on and let your init function fail somewhere in the middle.)

(What usually should happen is sm like this:

void binderfs_remove_file(struct dentry *dentry)
{
	struct inode *parent_inode;

	parent_inode = d_inode(dentry->d_parent);
	inode_lock(parent_inode);
	if (simple_positive(dentry)) {
		dget(dentry);
		simple_unlink(parent_inode, dentry);
		d_delete(dentry);
		dput(dentry);
	}
	inode_unlock(parent_inode);
})

My point was this:
Afaict, nowhere in ima are the stashed dentries needed apart from
ima_policy_release() which is the .release method of the
file_operations where the policy dentry is removed.

The dentries only exist because for pre-namespaced ima if you created a
dentry going through securityfs_create_dentry() you're pinning the
super_block of init-securityfs via simple_pin_fs(). That obliges you to
call securityfs_remove() later on in order to call simple_unpin_fs() for
all dentries.

But for namespaced-ima with namespaced-securityfs there is no more call
to simple_{pin,unpin}_fs(). Consequently you don't need to stash the
dentries anywhere to have them available for removal later on. They will
be automatically cleaned up during .kill_sb().

The one exception I was unaware of reading the code before is in
ima_policy_release(). So apologies, I didn't see that. There you remove:

static int ima_release_policy(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
	struct ima_namespace *ns = get_current_ns();
	const char *cause = ns->valid_policy ? "completed" : "failed";

	if ((file->f_flags & O_ACCMODE) == O_RDONLY)
		return seq_release(inode, file);

	if (ns->valid_policy && ima_check_policy(ns) < 0) {
		cause = "failed";
		ns->valid_policy = 0;
	}

	pr_info("policy update %s\n", cause);
	integrity_audit_msg(AUDIT_INTEGRITY_STATUS, NULL, NULL,
			    "policy_update", cause, !ns->valid_policy, 0);

	if (!ns->valid_policy) {
		ima_delete_rules(ns);
		ns->valid_policy = 1;
		clear_bit(IMA_FS_BUSY, &ns->ima_fs_flags);
		return 0;
	}

	ima_update_policy(ns);
#if !defined(CONFIG_IMA_WRITE_POLICY) && !defined(CONFIG_IMA_READ_POLICY)
	securityfs_remove(ns->dentry[IMAFS_DENTRY_IMA_POLICY]);
	ns->dentry[IMAFS_DENTRY_IMA_POLICY] = NULL;

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

But even so, why then stash all those dentries if the only dentry that
you ever remove while ima is active - and ima isn't a module so can't be
unloaded - is the IMAFS_DENTRY_IMA_POLICY. Simply stash the single
dentry in struct ima_namespace and forget about all the other ones and
avoid wasting memory. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

I'm going to get my booster shot and hopefully I'll be able to work
tomorrow and later today but I wouldn't bet on it.
