It should fix these races as well. Both task->patch_state and
TIF_PATCH_PENDING flag are almost always modified under tasklist_lock.

One exception is klp_update_patch_state(current) but it could not
race because klp_copy_process() is called under spinlock.
So that "current" can't sleep and can't get migrated in the middle of
klp_copy_process().

Another exception is klp_check_and_switch_task() that is called
under p->pi_lock. It prevents rescheduling and the task will be
migrated only when sleeping. As a result "current" again
can't get migrated inside klp_copy_process().

Finally, the state of "idle" tasks (idle_task(cpu)) is updated
without tasklist_lock. But they are not forked so that we are
on safe side.

We should update the commit message and mention also the other
two locations where the state is manipulated without tasklist_lock.
I am sorry that I did not mention it on Friday.

Also we should remove "I have not figured yet whether". The patch
should fix these races as well.

With the above changes:
