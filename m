Fair points.

Ah, I think I misunderstood you there. I thought you were advocating for
creating compatibles for each SoC just because it's a new SoC and things
might be different. I'm not at all against naming this something like
qcom,tee-uefisecapp-sc8180x then using that on all platforms that work.
I just didn't like the idea of having a bunch of different
qcom,tee-uefisecapp-<soc> pointing to the exact same thing without any
difference at all.

Fair point. By shifting that to device links you'll at least know what
it's waiting for and the driver won't attempt to probe until that's
resolved. But your question applies to that then as well: How do you
differentiate between the device link or supplier being broken somehow
and the supplier being just not ready yet?

Looking at the TrEE driver in [1] and thinking of future additions
(re-entrant calls, callbacks/listeners, ..., all of which would require
some state), combining both might be the best option: Have a TrEE main
device for the interface that links up with SCM and then define the apps
as children under that TrEE device.
