This particular change is safe in the current design.
klp_enable_patch() is called from the module_init() callback
where patch->mod->name is defined. So it can't change.

The problem is that it is not obvious that it is safe. One has to
think about it. Also it might become dangerous when someone
tries to call klp_enable_livepatch() for another livepatch module.

Thanks for understanding.
