I don't think we can make something less consistent if there is no real
consistency.) There are at most five ops descriptors can be defined in
the DW PCIe platform drivers:

1. struct dw_pcie_ops - DW PCIe DBI interface accessors,
+-> dw_pcie_ops
+-> <vendor>_pcie_ops
+-> <vendor>_dw_pcie_ops

2. struct pci_ops     - own or child PCIe config space accessors,
+-> dw_pcie_ops !!! in the driver core.
+-> <vendor>_pci_ops
+-> <vendor>_pcie_ops
+-> dw_child_pcie_ops
+-> <vendor>_child_pcie_ops
+-> <vendor>_child_pci_ops

3. struct dw_pcie_host_ops - DW PCIe Root Port init/de-init operations
+-> <vendor>_pcie_host_ops
+-> <vendor>_pcie_dw_host_ops

4. struct dw_pcie_ep_ops   - DW PCIe Endpoint init/de-init operations
+-> pcie_ep_ops
+-> pci_ep_ops
+-> <vendor>_pcie_ep_ops

As you can see each can have different naming approaches used in the
DW PCIe platform drivers here and there. Some of them have been utilized
more frequently, some of them - less. As for me what is really consistent
across all the DW PCIe platform drivers is the local namespace prefix
of the form "<vendor>_pcie". It is used in all the locally defined
functions names and more-or-less mainly in the local instances of the
operation descriptors. So if you want we can pick some approach and
make sure it is used in all the driver from now on. For instance,

struct dw_pcie_ops <vendor>_pcie_ops
struct dw_pcie_host_ops <vendor>_pcie_host_ops
struct dw_pcie_ep_ops <vendor>_pcie_ep_ops
struct pci_ops <vendor>_pci_ops // Can be confused with the struct
                                // dw_pcie_ops instance, but this what
                                // is mainly used in the available drivers.
struct pci_ops <vendor>_child_pci_ops // less frequent naming
                                      // approach, but it looks more
                                      // like the own CFG-space IOs.

Note the later two cases will violate the local namespace naming
convention of having "<vendor>_pcie" prefix.

In my case the names would look like:
struct dw_pcie_ops bt1_pcie_ops // What you suggest in the comment above
struct dw_pcie_host_ops bt1_pcie_host_ops
struct pci_ops bt1_pci_ops // It may look ambiguous with bt1_pcie_ops.

Ok. I'll drop it from the driver then.

host_init content is very platform-specific. So each driver has its own
callback implementation and logical sub-methods split up. My case
isn't an exception.

Right. It is supposed to be "assert" in accordance with what is

Ok. I'll replace the literals with the macros.

Well, if there were a consistency in the probe method design it would
have been another story, but in case of the DW PCIe there is none.
Some DW PCIe platform drivers perform all the probe actions right in
the probe method forming a long list of the weakly coherent things,
some of them have a few sub-functions called but still look the same,
some of them are mainly split up in the sub-methods, but still perform
some initialization right in the probe method. So in general there is
no unification and well defined convention in that regard.

My approach on the contrary makes the probe method code well unified.
Should any new additional step is required, the new method can be
added together with the cleanup antagonist. Similarly the
sub-methods update patches is easier to review than reading the
all-in-one probe code update. Moreover such design approach I've
been using in all the drivers submitted by me to the kernel and no
questions have been raised so far. Finally the driver is supposed to
be maintained by its author at the very least. So I definitely won't
have any problem with it especially after using the same design
pattern in all my drivers.

See the last comment. It concerns the same methods, but you suggest to
use the names "*_add_port()" there.
