I probably misunderstand, but the above is not generally true, is it? I 
mean, if the transition patch is forced during its disablement, it does 
not say anything about the amount of enabled patches.

But it is not the same. ->replace being true only comes into play when a 
patch is enabled. If it is disabled, then it behaves like any other patch.

So, if there is ->replace patch enabled (and it is the only patch present) 
and then more !->replace patches are loaded and then if ->replace patch is 
disabled and forced, your proposal would give a different result than what 
Chengming submitted, because in your case all the other patches will get 
->forced set to true, while it is not the case in the original. It would 
be an unnecessary restriction if I am not missing something.

However, I may got lost somewhere along the way.
