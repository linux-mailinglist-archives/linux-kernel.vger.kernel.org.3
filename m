"core_init_notifer" flag was added to let the EPF driver know that the
endpoint controller has completed its initialization. This is needed for
platforms that require refclk from the host to be active before accessing
any controller specific registers. Tegra194 and Qcom are one of those kinds.

DBI access requires refclk on the above mentioned platforms, so yes
there is a strong connection.

This patch (also mine) moves away all of the DBI access to the
init_complete() notifier callback. Because, without this patch we need
to bring-up the host first and then power-on the endpoint. Otherwise,
if the endpoint is powered-on first, it will crash as there would no
refclk from host.

FWIW, Vidya's patch looks good to me. I pointed out my patch just
because it covers the theoretical issue mentioned by Kishon.
