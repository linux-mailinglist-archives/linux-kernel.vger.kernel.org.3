A DSS VP is a DSS internal port, whereas a port node in the DT is an 
external port. There doesn't have to be a 1:1 match between those.

The port in the DT represents some kind of "connector" to the outside 
world, which is usually a collection of pins that provide a video bus.

Here, as far as I can see, the DSS clearly has three external ports, two 
OLDI ports and one DPI port.

This, and using simple-panel for dual link with single port connection, 
sounds like a hack.

A practical example: TI's customer wants to use AM625 and THC63LVD1024 
bridge. How does it work? THC63LVD1024 driver uses two LVDS ports for 
input, both of which are used in dual-link mode.

If I'm not mistaken, those properties are in the port node, not the 
device node, and also, I believe those properties are on the sink side, 
so they wouldn't even be in the AM625 data. See, for example:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/r8a774c0-ek874-idk-2121wr.dts

No, I'm only talking about the DT port nodes. At the moment the AM65x DT 
bindings doc says that there are two ports, port@0 for OLDI and port@1 
for DPI. I'm saying AM625 needs three ports.
