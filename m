Changes from V6:[3]
	The big change is the removal of the auxiliary bus code from the PCI
	layer.  The auxiliary bus usage is now in the CXL layer.  The PCI layer
	provides helpers for subsystems to utilize DOE mailboxes by creating a
	pci_doe_mb object which controls a state machine for that mailbox
	capability.  The CXL layer wraps this object in an auxiliary device and
	driver which can then be used to determine if the kernel is controlling
	the capability or it is available to be used by user space.  Reads from
	user space via lspci are allowed.  Writes are allowed but flagged via a
	tainting the kernel.

	Feedback from Bjorn, Jonathan, and Dan
		Details in each patch

Changes from V5:[0]

	Rework the patch set to split PCI vs CXL changes
		Also make each change a bit more stand alone for easier review
	Add cxl_cdat structure
	Put CDAT related data structures in cdat.h
	Clarify some device lifetimes with comments
	Incorporate feedback from Jonathan, Bjorn and Dan
		The bigest change is placing the DOE scanning code into the
			pci_doe driver (part of the PCI codre).
		Validate the CDAT when it is read rather than before DSMAS
			parsing
		Do not report DSMAS failure as an error, report a warning and
			keep going.
		Retry reading the table 1 time.
	Update commit messages and this cover letter



CXL drivers need various data which are provided through generic DOE mailboxes
as defined in the PCIe 6.0 spec.[1]

One such data is the Coherent Device Atribute Table (CDAT).  CDAT data provides
coherent information about the various devices in the system.  It was developed
because systems no longer have a priori knowledge of all coherent devices
within a system.  CDAT describes the coherent characteristics of the
components on the CXL bus separate from system configurations.  The OS can
then, for example, use this information to form correct interleave sets.

To begin reading the CDAT the OS must have support to access the DOE mailboxes
provided by the CXL devices.

Because DOE is not specific to DOE but is provided within the PCI spec, the
series adds PCI DOE capability library functions.  These functions allow for
the iteration of the DOE capabilities on a device as well as creating
pci_doe_mb structures which can control the operation of the DOE state machine.

CXL iterates the DOE capabilities creates auxiliary bus devices.  These devices
are driven by a CXL DOE auxiliary driver which calls into the PCI DOE library
functions as appropriate.

The auxiliary bus architecture allows for root users to control which DOE
mailboxes are controlled by the kernel and which should be allowed for
unrestricted access by user space.  One such use case is to allow for CXL
Compliance Testing (CXL 2.0 14.16.4 Compliance Mode DOE).  By default the
kernel controls all mailboxes found.

After the devices are created and the driver attaches, CDAT data is read from
the device and DSMAS information parsed from that CDAT blob for use later.

This work was tested using qemu with additional patches.
