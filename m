I have also no concrete clue, either :)
At least, drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_iommu.c calls
amd_iommu_init_device(), and this invokes iommu_attach_group(), which
may change group->domain.  But it was just my wild guess, and it might
be others, indeed.

OK, will try to build a test kernel with some debug prints and ask the
reporters.  It may take some time.

Yeah it's something odd ;)

I'm not sure whether the people tested HD-audio capability at all, but
otherwise they might have noticed.
