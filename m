It does not seem right if there were two functions trying to determine 
whether an x509 cert is self-signed. The existing is invoked as part of 
loading a key onto the machine keyring from what I can see. It has 
access to more data about the cert and therefore can do stronger tests, 
yours doesn't have access to the data. So I guess I would remember in a 
boolean in the public key structure that the x509 cert it comes from was 
self signed following the existing test. Key in your function may be 
that that payload->data[] array is guaranteed to be from the x509 cert 
as set in x509_key_preparse().
