That raises me a same question. Could you also look at the zswap stat
instead of adding it into vmstat? (If zswap doesn't have the counter,
couldn't we simply add new stat in sysfs?)

I thought the patch aims for exposting statistics to grab easier
using popular meminfo and vmstat and wanted to leverage it for
zram, too.
