Memory maps for mvebu are more complicated. There is no explicit size in
DT ranges property as it is dynamically allocated by mvebu-mbus:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-385.dtsi?h=v5.15#n47

On some Armada platform (I think it is AXP) there is lot of SerDeses
with PCIe functionality (I think six or seven?) but "shared memory pool"
which mvebu-mbus allocates to consumers is not big enough to allow e.g.
256 MB + 64 kB for every PCIe port.

There is upper limit of mvebu memory slots in HW and each slot has size
restrictions. So mvebu-mbus has to deal with splitting requested
PCIe window to more mvebu memory slots... So even if there is available
memory for assigning then there does not have to be a free slot.

Due to nature of plugable PCIe expansion cards, you are basically free
to put any PCIe card which you like into any PCIe slot. So it would be
up to the user to choose combination of such cards which pass all those
mvebu windows and slots restrictions... Otherwise kernel just say that
cannot satisfy card's BAR assignment because it is not possible to set
forwarding windows correctly.

Moreover it is possible to bind / unbind pci mvebu device dynamically at
runtime (also by rmmod), so whole resource allocation in mvebu-bus is
dynamic even during system runtime. So theoretically user can unbind one
driver to free some memory and then can bind another (which needs more
memory).

I think that this pci-mvebu driver and HW is very unusual in both
resource assignment and supported features and requirements from SW.

I see. In this situation it does not work correctly.

But is not kernel itself "privileged" to setup forwarding windows?
Because currently kernel does not do it and therefore do we need to care
for it?

Or do you have idea how to handle this kind of situation? Or how to
handle these kinds of errors?
