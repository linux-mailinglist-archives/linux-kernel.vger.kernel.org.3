Yes, but that is exactly what also happens for normal commit. I.e. even
without fastcommits, if we fsync(2), we will flush out data for that file
but for all the other files, buffered data still stays in delalloc state in
the page cache. Following journal commit will thus write all metadata (and
wait for data) of the fsynced files but not for any other file that has
only delalloc blocks. If writeback of some other file also happened before
we commit, then yes, we include all the changes to the commit as well.

What you describe is correct but not special to fastcommit. As I mentioned
on the call yesterday, fastcommit is currently beneficial only because the
logical logging it does ends up writing much less blocks to the journal.
