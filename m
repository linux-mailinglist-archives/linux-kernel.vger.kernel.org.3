I've already responded to following email, but I'll repeat it here for
completeness. It's not a special bootloader.  It's the opposite, it's
a generic UEFI compliant bootloader which takes advantage of the fact
EFI is extensible. We are doing something very similar in how we load
our initrd via the EFI_LOAD_FILE2 protocol.  Whether Qualcomm can add
that to their bootloaders is a different topic though.  But at some
point we need to draw a line than keep overloading the DT because a
vendor decided to go down it's own path.

But it *is* a bootloader problem.  The bootloader is aware of the fact
that it can't provide runtime services for X reasons and that's
exactly why we are trying to set EFI_RT_PROPERTIES_TABLE correctly
from the firmware.  All we are doing is install a config table to tell
the OS "I can't do that, can you find a way around it?".
