Hi,

The problem was first found during kernel upgrade(v3.10 to v4.18), and
we maintain a series of io performance test suites, and one of the test
is fio random rw with large bs. In the environment, the 'max_sectors_kb'
is 256kb, and fio bs is 1m.

If the use case that large ios get submitted together is not a common
issueï¼ˆprobably not since it's been a long time without complaining),
I agree that we should not optimize the block layer for that.
