This change as commit 5bffe4c611f5 ("PCI/PM: Rework changing power
states of PCI devices") causes my AMD-based system to fail to fully
boot. As far as I can tell, this might be NVMe related, which might make
getting a full log difficult, as journalctl won't have anywhere to save
it. I see:

nvme nvme0: I/O 8 QID 0 timeout, completion polled

then shortly afterwards:

nvme nvme0: I/O 24 QID 0 timeout, completion polled
nvme nvme0: missing or invalid SUBNQN field

then I am dropped into an emergency shell.

This is a log from the previous commit, which may give some hints about
the configuration of this particular system.

If there is any additional debugging information I can provide or
patches I can try, please let me know!

Cheers,
Nathan
