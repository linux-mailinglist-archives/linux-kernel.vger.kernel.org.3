Sorry for insufficient explanation of my concern.  In short, I'm concerning
about the regions adjustment.

You may do so by storing NUMA-local access count and NUMA-remote access
count in the nr_acceses filed of each region, e.g., saving NUMA-local access
count in upper-half bits of nr_accesses and saving NUMA-remote access count in
the lower-half bits.  However, then DAMON will do the regions adjustment based
on the NUMA-local/remote accesses count mixed value, so the accuracy would be
degraded.  So I think we need to implement each monitoring operations set for
each accesses that we want to monitor.

My previous comment above might help clarifying my concern.

If I'm missing something, please let me know.
