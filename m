I guess it's wrong wording in the last paragraph. It's not safe, but it's
_required_ since HW doesn't follow PCI specification that clearly says:
"MSI, MSI-X, and INTx are mutually exclusive".

This is also supported by the other devices on the same chipset doing
that and by the reported of the issue.
