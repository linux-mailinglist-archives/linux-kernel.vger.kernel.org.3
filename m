Eric, for me it would be at least a convenience, and overally it would
make sure that I pick the right thing if you would fix the typos (and
you can add all the tested-by tags of course as no functional changes).

There's been times when I've manually "just fixed typos", and failed in a
way or another because of human error. Just want to make sure that we
have exactly the right content applied, I hope you understand my point
of view. And we are early for the 5.18 release cycle anyway.

BR, Jarkko
