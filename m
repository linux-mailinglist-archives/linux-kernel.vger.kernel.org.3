I tentatively put this on my pci/host/mt7621 branch.  The only
non-mt7621 change is the pci_register_host_bridge() change, which
seems innocuous, so maybe we can still squeeze it in.

I squashed these patches together:

  MIPS: ralink: implement 'pcibios_root_bridge_prepare()'
  PCI: mt7621: Avoid custom MIPS code in driver code

because the first adds the coherency setup to the MIPS
pcibios_root_bridge_prepare(), and the second removes that same code
from pcie-mt7621.c.  I think it makes more sense to do it as a move in
a single patch, both for ease of reviewing and for potential
bisection.
