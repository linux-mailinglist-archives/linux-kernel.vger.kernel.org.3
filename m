Well, but 'dispatched' is used in quite a few places and it would require
quite some thinking to decide which impact using 'inflight' has there...
But we also have 'bfqq->entity.allocated' which is number of requests in
some state associated with bfqq and we could use that. But as I wrote in my
previous email, I'm not convinced it is really necessary...
