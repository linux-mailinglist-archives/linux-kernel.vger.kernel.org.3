I agree, that was also my conclusion after doing some measurements.

Basically, the little cores are always cold and are victims of the big 
cores heat dissipation.

They of course contribute a bit to the heat but capping their 
performance does not change the temperature trend of the whole.

That is less true with silver-gold were it is the same micro-arch but 
different frequencies.
