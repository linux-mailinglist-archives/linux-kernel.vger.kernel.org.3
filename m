That is definitely one solution, but maybe not the best one.

Another approach I thought of is:

1) after monitor work aborts the device, send one KOBJ_CHANGE event of
/dev/ublkcN to userspace, and userspace should check if the situation
needs to be recovered, no matter yes or not, it should tell ublk driver
via one control command

2) meantime monitor work starts a timer to monitor if the expected
command is received during one reasonable period. If not, the device
will be stopped. Otherwise the driver decides to recover or not.

The above should be done easily.

Let's start simply. If everything doesn't work as expected, terminate
recovery and stop the disk.

Yeah, sometimes 'kill -9' is very useful for me to handle IO hang, then no
reboot is needed.

But it is just for debug or development of ublksrv, and that can be
thought of early shape of container-ware block device, and other kind of
block devices can't have such privilege, :-)

True, that is why I raise the question because the problem to be
solved needs to be defined first.
