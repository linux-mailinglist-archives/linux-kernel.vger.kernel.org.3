I think it might be more straight-forward to always accept pages in the
size of the pageblock. Smaller ranges should matter because they have been
accepted in deferred_free_range. In expand, if PageUnaccepted is set on
a pageblock-sized page, take it off the list, drop the zone->lock leaving
IRQs disabled, accept the memory and reacquire the lock to split the page
into the required order.

IRQs being left disabled is unfortunate but even if the acceptance is slow,
it's presumably not so slow to cause major problems. This would would reduce
and probably eliminate the need to do the assert check in accept_page. It
might also simplify __free_one_page if it's known that a pageblock range
of pages are either all accepted or unaccepted.

Lastly, the default behaviour should probably be "accept all memory at
boot" and use Kconfig to allow acceptable be deferred or overridden by
command line. There are at least two reasons for this. Even though this
is a virtual machine, there still may be latency sensitive applications
running early in boot using pinned vcpu->pcpu and no memory overcommit.
The unpredictable performance of the application early in boot may be
unacceptable and unavoidable. It might take a long time but it could
eventually generate bug reports about "unpredictable performance early
in boot" that will be hard to track down unless accept_memory is observed
using perf at the right time. Even when that does happen, there will need
to be an option to turn it off if the unpredictable performance cannot
be tolerated. Second, any benchmarking done early in boot is likely to
be disrupted making the series a potential bisection magnet that masks a
performance bug elsewhere in the merge window.
