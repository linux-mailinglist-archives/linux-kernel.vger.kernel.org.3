Since platform makers can't converge on how to let a driver know what
it's supposed to do, I suggest we default to the simple shutdown suspend
all the time. We can add a module parameter to let a user request nvme
power management if they really want it. No matter what we do here,
someone is going to complain, but at least simple shutdown is safe...
