But again, with CONFIG_PREEMPT, that doesn't work.

I wouldn't be necessarily opposed to changing the kpatch timeout to
something bigger, or eliminating it altogether in favor of a WARN()
after x minutes.

If it's a real bug, we should fix it everywhere, not just for Facebook.
Otherwise CONFIG_PREEMPT and/or non-x86 arches become second-class
