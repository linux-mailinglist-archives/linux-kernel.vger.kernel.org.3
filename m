My first thought was any controller with a fixed math constrains like
cpu controller. But I have to admit that I haven't really checked
whether imprecision can accumulate and propagate outside of the
hierarchy.

Another concern I would have is a id space depletion. At least memory
controller depends on idr ids which have a space that is rather limited
#define MEM_CGROUP_ID_MAX       USHRT_MAX

Also the runtime overhead would increase with a large number of cgroups.
Take a global memory reclaim as an example. All the cgroups have to be
iterated. This will have an impact outside of the said hierarchy. One
could argue that limiting untrusted top level cgroups would be a certain
mitigation but I can imagine this could get very non trivial easily.

Anyway, let me just be explicit. I am not against these patches. In fact
I cannot really judge their overhead. But right now I am not really sure
they are going to help much against untrusted users.
