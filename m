Those consumers are endpoint drivers, so I think this depends on those
drivers correctly unmapping the interrupts they use, right?

Can you elaborate on this?  I think Marc is suggesting that these PCI
controller drivers be modular but not removable.  Why would that cause
more of them to be compiled-in?

The driver model ensures that endpoint drivers have been unbound. But
doesn't the interrupt disposal depend on the correct functioning of
those endpoint drivers?  So if a buggy endpoint driver failed to
dispose of them, we're still vulnerable?
