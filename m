I'd like to mention here that ChromeOS also runs linux kernel on TGL
and ADL platforms, and we may run a different BIOS altogether, so yes,
we'd greatly appreciate if you do not assume BIOS setting from device
ID / SOC ID, if the setting is *not tied to device ID / SOC ID*.
Perhaps you use ACPI or device trees to convey what BIOS has or hasn't
configured?

Yes, reading the ASPM configuration from hardware sounds OK to me.

Should the Policy override really take place if aspm_policy =3D
POLICY_DEFAULT which seems to suggest we leave it to whatever BIOS
left it at?

Perhaps for this override to take place, aspm_policy needs to be the
policy needs to be POLICY_POWERSAVE?

#define POLICY_DEFAULT 0        /* BIOS default setting */
#define POLICY_PERFORMANCE 1    /* high performance */
#define POLICY_POWERSAVE 2      /* high power saving */
#define POLICY_POWER_SUPERSAVE 3 /* possibly even more power saving */

Bjorn: from https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-techno=
logy/intel-volume-management-device-overview.html
"Intel=C2=AE Volume Management Device (Intel=C2=AE VMD) is specifically des=
igned
for enterprise-grade management of NVMe SSDs connected to Intel=C2=AE Xeon=
=C2=AE
CPUs."

I think what David means is that any other device other than an NVME
SSD showing up under VMD might be an error / bad device.

As described here and as much as I understand, I think these LTR
values (0x1003 here) depend on the platform topology. So what works
for David's platform may not work for another one that may have
Switched for e.g., or for perhaps for another NVME that is hotplugged
later (and has different characteristics than what is on board).
Technically tying the LTR values to a SOC or VID/DID sounds incorrect
to me, and instead should be tied to the platform. Ideally I *thiink*
they should come from ACPI or device tree. However, I wouldn't protest
putting them in driver_data for now given that there aren't any other
users. We may have to find a solution once there are more platforms
that begin to use this driver. I think this is a bigger problem that
needs to be addressed w.r.t. ASPM in general.

Thanks & Best Regards,

Rajat
