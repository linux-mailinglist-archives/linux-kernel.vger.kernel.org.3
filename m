Correct, I am referring to the leaf cluster node identifier in terms
of cpu-map DT node which we now store in cpu_topology[cpu].cluster_id as
part of this series instead of previous cpu_topology[cpu].package_id.

(1) Do we have any platforms with nested clusters today ? No phantom
    clusters please as this is info that gets to the userspace and must
    reflect the real hardware. If one exist, then we need to add nested
    cluster if we need to support that hardware. I am not aware of any
    platform in particular DT based one.
(2) LLC was added to support chiplets. IIRC, cpu_coregroup_mask was changed
    to select the smallest of LLC, socket siblings, and NUMA node siblings
    to ensure that the sched domain we build for the MC layer isn't larger
    than the DIE above it or it's shrunk to the socket or NUMA node if LLC
    exist across NUMA node/chiplets.

   But overtime, we have patched cpu_coregroup_mask to workaround things
   which I think is now about to break üôÅ.
