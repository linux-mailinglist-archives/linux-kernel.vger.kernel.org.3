Yes! There is already pending fix for U-Boot which will fix this bug:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/uboot/patch/20220223125232.7974-1-kabel@kernel.org/

But because older U-Boot version is already in production we cannot
change this.

And changing it would result in non-bootable kernels or crashing
kernels... So possible non-working card is better choice.

Note that non-working cards are only those which do not support 32-bit
I/O ports, which is probably only some ancient PCI or ISA cards. I have
checked 3 random mPCIe SATA controllers which use I/O ports and they
support 32-bit I/O addressing, so I guess these cards should not be
affected at all.

Yes, by converting DTS to board platform data, stop using DTS and
dynamically fill board platform data by kernel code... hehe :D nothing
which we want.

Probably it could be possible to write drivers which would ignore
address resources in DTS and fill kernel structured dynamically from HW
registers, in similar way how old platform data on arm32 worked in the
past. But this is too much work for which I do not see real usage. I'm
really not going to use ISA card connected to PCI-to-ISA bridge
connected itself to PCIe-to-PCI bridge and this connected to A3720 SoC.

If somebody is really want to use this setup, then it is easier to
upgrade bootloader (patch is already pending) and manually edit DTS file
to remap I/O space to bus address 0x0. This edit can be automated by
U-Boot script (or U-Boot driver).

It is really easier to do upgrade+fix bootloader and modify DTB on the
fly than hacking kernel to support older bootloaders which are already
in use.
