Thanks for reminding me about this.  I don't remember why I marked it
"changes requested" but I often do that if there's been significant
discussion.  In this case you also provided additional information
(Fixes tag, bugzilla link, commit log elaboration) that should be
included.  Given that, I would typically wait for the author to repost
it and incorporate the additional information.

But I applied it to pci/hotplug with the commit log below.

commit 92912b175178 ("PCI: pciehp: Clear cmd_busy bit in polling mode")
Author: Liguang Zhang <zhangliguang@linux.alibaba.com>

    PCI: pciehp: Clear cmd_busy bit in polling mode
    
    Writes to a Downstream Port's Slot Control register are PCIe hotplug
    "commands."  If the Port supports Command Completed events, software must
    wait for a command to complete before writing to Slot Control again.
    
    pcie_do_write_cmd() sets ctrl->cmd_busy when it writes to Slot Control.  If
    software notification is enabled, i.e., PCI_EXP_SLTCTL_HPIE and
    PCI_EXP_SLTCTL_CCIE are set, ctrl->cmd_busy is cleared by pciehp_isr().
    
    But when software notification is disabled, as it is when pcie_init()
    powers off an empty slot, pcie_wait_cmd() uses pcie_poll_cmd() to poll for
    command completion, and it neglects to clear ctrl->cmd_busy, which leads to
    spurious timeouts:
    
      pcieport 0000:00:03.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x01c0 (issued 2264 msec ago)
      pcieport 0000:00:03.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x05c0 (issued 2288 msec ago)
    
    Clear ctrl->cmd_busy in pcie_poll_cmd() when it detects a Command Completed
    event (PCI_EXP_SLTSTA_CC).
