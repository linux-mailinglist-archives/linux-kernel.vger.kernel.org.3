ACPI (and the specific UEFI implementation) might remain unaware of
VMD domains. It's possible that the system management mode (SMM)
controller which typically handles firmware-first errors would be
capable of handling VMD errors in the vendor-specific manner.
However if _OSC hadn't taken into account VMD ports, SMM wouldn't
be capable of handling those errors and silently disabling AER on
VMD domains is a bad idea.

The bugzilla made it sound like a specific platform/drive combination.
What about a DMI match to mask the Corrected Physical Layer bits?
