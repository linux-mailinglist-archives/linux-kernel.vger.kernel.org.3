The whole point here is that we don't have control over that. I'd like
to fix the firmware, but we're talking about WoA devices where, let's
face it, both device and SoC vendor don't really care about Linux. Even
if you'd convince them to implement that for future generations, you'd
still need them to push firmware updates for older generations.
Generations that are end-of-life. IMHO, we should still try support
those. Or we just say "sorry, Linux doesn't support that on your WoA
device".

The only thing that is making the installation-process for end-users
device dependent is installing the DTB. We can handle the device
specific stuff in the kernel, just as we already handle buggy devices.

Further, you seem to assume that these devices provide a DT in the first
place. WoA devices use ACPI, so they don't. But for the time being (as
discussed elsewhere) we unfortunately need to stick with DTs and can't
really use ACPI. I agree that we should avoid OS and use-case specific
DTs, but I don't see how this would make a DT use-case or OS specific.
Things are firmware specific, the interface doesn't change with a
different OS, and we're only indicating the presence of that interface.

My current suggestion (already sent to Sudeep earlier) is (roughly)
this: Add one compatible for the TrEE / TrustZone interface. Then decide
to load or instantiate what needs to be loaded in the driver for that.
That (depending on maybe SoC / platform / vendor) includes installing
the efivar operations. This way we don't have to fill the DT with the
specific things running in firmware.

Max
