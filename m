That's what my patchset starts from. See the {reset,clock,reg}-names
properties definitions in the snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml schema being added
in the framework of the patch
[PATCH v2 01/17] dt-bindings: PCI: dwc: Define common and native DT bindings
in this series.

If it was that easy I would have done that in the first place.) Even
though there is well defined set of the clocks and resets a normal DW
PCIe RP/EP controller can have (see the list in the patch log), the
way they are toggled and the signal sources due to the controller
complexity in the most of the cases is platform-dependent.  Just
enabling and de-asserting all of them likely will never work. So such
function would be just useless. In addition to that there are signals
like app_ltssm_enable or phy/link reset request which needs to be
checked at some point of the reset procedure. The way these signals
are available in the system is also platform-dependent (syscon,
additional CSRs blocks, etc). Thirdly there can be PHY viewport CSRs
available in the DW PCIe Port Logic CSRs which can be used on the
platforms to tune the PHY settings up during the cold reset process.
Finally the platform-specific timings between the reset signals
assertion/de-assertion need to be preserved. Taking all of that into
account would cause having a very complicated generic clock/reset
handling procedure.

Synopsys provides a Verilog module called DWC_pcie_clkrst.v/CLK_RST.v
which can be used by the platform engineers to implement the clocks
generation and cold/hot reset without much software interference. But
it isn't always possible to predict the timings being required on the
real silicon. So the hw engineers mainly omit such module and rely on the
software to implement the proper reset procedure, which due to many
reasons (PHY settings, timings, etc) mostly differs from SoC-to-SoC.

So to speak I don't think that we can (should?) create some truly
generic at least cold start procedure due to too many variables at
stake (though the one implemented in my Baikal-T1 PCIe driver, last
patch in the series, follows the cold procedure described in the hw
reference manual). At least IMO it won't be possible without many
hooks inside such method with platform-dependent signals checking and
delays. So the only generic thing that we can indeed implement is to
have the clock and reset structure pointers inside the DWC core and
create a generic platform resources request/release methods. Even in
that case these methods can't be called from the generic
host/end-point probe procedure and need to be invoked from the
platform-specific host_init/host_deinit methods by the platforms
themself. It's because there are so many platforms already
implemented. If I try to consolidate all their resource
request/release parts in a single method, it most likely cause the
regression.

What do you think if I would just create the arrays with pointers to the
generic clk/reset structures in the DWC private data, implement their
request (release won't be required due to devm-methods utilization)
procedure and use it in the framework of my driver only for now?

Well, I've provided a driver (the last patch in this series) which
design can be used as a reference to implement the clocks/reset
request procedure with a help of the submitted in this patch tables.
But if you are agree with creating a generic resource request method,
the clocks/reset request part of it can be re-designed, simplified
and moved to that method.
