Hello Elad!

Thank you very much for your response! Together with Krzysztof we were
unable to get any response regarding this issue for more than year.

I would kindly ask if you/Marvell could publish description of this
errata to Linux kernel developers, so more kernel developers can look at
it and try to implement workarounds.

Together with Krzysztof we have really an issue to retrieve any kind of
documentation or user guide for Armada 3720 erratas/bugs.

Rest of my comments I'm putting inline below.

I observed this fatal abort on CPU when endpoint PCIe card sent
interrupt to A3720 PCIe controller and interrupt handler in driver for
endpoint card did PCIe memory write to PCIe card memory space.

Writing to PCIe address range for PCIe MEM of endpoint card cause that
A3720 PCIe controller sends fatal unrecoverable error to CPU.

Here is the crashlog from mediatek wifi card which I captured year ago.

(in other SoC/systems, including Marvell, is this card working fine)

It is from older kernel, but issue is still there and happens also with
new kernels. Mediatek driver in its interrupt handler is masking some
interrupts in its interrupt handler, which is done by writing to PCIe
address space of endpoint card.

Anyway, I can reproduce same crash when I set PCIe link down or reset
link and trying to read from PCIe MEM or CFG space. Seems that PCIe
controller incorrectly reports errors to CPU, it should return all-ones
when PCIe device is not present (e.g. during link down) and not send
fatal abort to CPU. I.e. instead of AXI OK with 0xffffffff data, it
sends AXI SLVERR to CPU which cause that crash.

This is something which should be configurable but I'm not able to find
any A3720 documentation which would describe how to configure it.

> Regarding the Erratum, basically to the best of my understanding, if the End Point is posting a PCIe write to the host, and the host is trying to read the End Point registers via PCIe, Completion data is generated . With the strong ordered mode, one would expect that first the post write will finish, and only then the completion data will be processed. The Erratum means that this mode is not supported. The DIS_ORD_CHK must be set to disable this feature, which is not supported by HW.

Ok, thank you for explanation!

> Regarding Bjorn comment, not enabling this bit will not help as the strong-order feature is not implemented in HW.
> Leaving this bit disabled will not make the HW enforce strong-order. There is no detailed description of the HW behavior when the bit is disabled per the default, but as is clearly evident from the Erratum and from your own experience, leaving this bit disabled would not create the correct, expected behavior from the HW, which is why it must be enabled for correct functionality of the system (both hardware and software).

What does it mean that strong-order feature is not implemented in HW?
Strong-order model is requirement in PCIe. This is really strange if
PCIe core requirement does not work in A3720 HW.

Anyway, in Marvell original A3720 PCIe driver is explicitly turned off
Relaxed PCIe ordering (and same is in mainline pci-aardvark.c driver):
https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/linux-marvell/blob/f12b3557095ff1d9b7be78bef7a3237e27b7778e/drivers/pci/host/pci-advk-arm64.c#L397

So if both Relaxed and Strong ordering are going to be disabled, what
kind of ordering model is then used? This is something which I do not
understand here.

> Regarding the patch - I would also add a full memory barrier (if you use interrupts on the host to handle the write completion - then in the PCIe driver interrupt handler, otherwise this will require modifying the specific WIFI driver) in order to minimize the risk for the race condition documented in the Erratum between the DMA done status reading and the completion of writing to the host memory. This of course does not guarantee order, but it is better than leaving it the way it is.

I'm not sure if I understand you correctly. Do you mean to call ARM DSB
instruction for Data Synchronization Barrier in A3720 PCIe summary
interrupt handler in pci-aardvark.c prior chaining to wifi driver
interrupt handler?
