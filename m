Sorry, this was a dumb idea, please ignore it.  Maybe it would be
useful in the future sometime, but right now when we're trying to
understand the issue, the code churn would just confuse things.  I
think we need minimal changes right now (like 4257f7e008ea).

Actually, I think it's unlikely that a downstream device would have
ASPM enabled while we're restoring state of the upstream device, since 
we're probably restoring state after a reset or coming back from
D3cold.  But we may still need to wait to enable the upstream device
ASPM until after configuring it in the downstream device.

Logging of the previous & new state of these registers might help
untangle things.
