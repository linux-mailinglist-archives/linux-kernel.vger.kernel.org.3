 This is misleading.  There are exactly 3 machine models (2 major ones and 
1 extra submodel) that we currently support which make use of this serial 
port hardware and driver, and they all have their R2000/R3000 MIPS CPU 
soldered onto their respective mainboards.  And the CPUs they use all have 
their page size hardwired to 4KiB, so it's not the lack of reports, but a 
firm assertion that this driver as it stands shall never be used with a 
different page size.

 There exists an option card using a DZ11-compatible chipset that can be 
used with systems we currently support with page sizes of up to 64KiB, but 
to the best of my knowledge only a number of prototype cards has been made 
and I have heard of exactly one person having such a card.  Therefore we 
do not support it and may never do, so it is not a concern for the driver 
as it stands and shall not be mentioned.

 Please just state then that the change is for design consistency with the 
serial core and redefine DZ_XMIT_SIZE in terms of UART_XMIT_SIZE as I 
suggested for v1.  I'll ack such a change.  Please drop 2/2 at this stage 
as it does not fix any bug and does not appear to add any value to this 
driver.

 Thanks,

  Maciej
