It's actually the opposite. The schemas in $defs are fixed-up, but you 
don't want them to be because your definition entries apply to a single 
entry where-as what the fix-ups do is make everything an array. It's 
debatable whether $defs should be fixed up or not, but I'm pretty sure 
we already have cases depending on the fixups.

This list is all the json-schema keywords which have a dictionary of DT 
properties under them. So $def belongs in the list. 'definitions' is not 
there as it is used in limited places and those that exist don't need 
fixups. Within the kernel tree, only $defs should be used and only if 
really necessary. Primarily, I think it is cases where it saves writing 
the same property schema more than once.


This patch is doing multiple things and should be split up some if 
possible. No doubt splitting the common schema from the 'generic' device 
schema is needed. We've done that in other cases. 

The main part I have issue with is how reg-names and interrupt-names are 
handled. For reg-names currently, if a platform wants to add another 
name, they have to modify the commmon binding. That's not great, but we 
don't want that to happen and don't want to make that easier to do. Part 
of the reason we have so many already is because no one stopped all the 
random variations of the same names. The biggest validation gap I see is 
we don't enforce the order and this patch does nothing to address that.
