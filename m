Yes, that makes sense to me. The bandwidth on the DSI side should match
the one required on the other side (HDMI). Apart the fact that the ADV
is working in mode 8.11.2 (Non-Burst Mode with Sync Pulses).

Hm.. I don't have the DSI spec either but I thought that BURST mode
allows the host to send the data as fast as possible and enter LP
afterwards.

Yes.

Good to know :)

Yes currently there is just this setting for setting the PLL freq. but
as you said for the "Non-Burst Mode with Sync Pulses" we need to
reconfigure it according the required bandwidth or the dsi-device tells
us about which dsi-link settings should be applied.

8<----------------------------------------------
   Selects Burst mode in Video mode

   In Non-burst mode, RGB data area is filled with RGB data and Null
   packets, according to input bandwidth of RGB interface.
   
   In Burst mode, RGB data area is filled with RGB data only.

   0 = Non-burst mode
   1 = Burst mode
8<----------------------------------------------

According the current implementation we are in Non-burst mode.

  Marco
