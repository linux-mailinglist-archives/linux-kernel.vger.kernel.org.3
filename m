Hi, Jan

I think with this change, we can count root_group while activating bfqqs
that are under root_group, thus there is no need to modify
for_each_entity(or fake bfq_sched_data) any more.

The special case is that weight racing bfqqs are not inserted into
weights tree, and I think this can be handled by adding a fake
bfq_weight_counter for such bfqqs.

What do you think ?

Kuai
