On an ACPI system, the host bridge window sizes are constrained by the
host bridge _CRS method.  I assume there's a similar constraint in DT.

Is the fact that mvebu_pcie_add_windows() can fail a symptom of a DT
that describes more available space than mvebu-bus can map?

Not sure I'm understanding the code correctly.  Here's the sort of
thing I'm worried about, but maybe this is actually impossible:

Let's say software writes (0x00, 0xff) to the I/O (base, limit), which
describes the [io 0x0000-0xffff] window.  If mvebu-mbus can't handle
that, it looks like you set the (base, limit) to (0xf0, 0x0f), which
would describe [io 0xf000-0x0fff], which is invalid.

The software writes 0x40 to the limit, so now we have (0xf0, 0x40), or
[io 0xf000-0x40ff].  That's still invalid, but software thinks the
0x00 it wrote to the base is still there.
