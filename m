Hi, Ming Lei

Just to be curiosity, I'm still trying to understand the logic here:

For example, if bps is set to 1k, and a io with size 16k is just
dispatched, then io throtle should wait for 16s untill new io can be 
dispatched. (details in tg_with_in_bps_limit）.

How does such mechanism bypassed here?

Thanks,
Kuai
