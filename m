Well securityfs is supposed to exist for LSMs.  At some point each of
those is going to need to be namespaced, which may eventually be quite
a pile of callbacks, which is why I thought of a notifier.

I don't think so; I think just moving some securityfs entries into the
user_namespace and managing the notifier chain from within securityfs
will do for now.  [although I'd have to spec this out in code before I
knew for sure].

Right, it's being activated by securityfs_ns_create_mount which is
called as soon as the user_ns is created.

Exactly, so I was thinking of not having a securityfs_ns_create_mount
at all.  All the securityfs_ns_create.. calls would be in the notifier
call chain. This means there's nothing to fill the superblock until an
actual mount on it is called.

So it would be called early in the init_user_ns by non-namespaced
consumers of securityfs, like it is now.

Namespaced consumers wouldn't call any securityfs_ns_create callbacks
to create dentries until they were notified from the fill_super
notifier, which would now only be triggered on first mount of
securityfs inside the namespace.

I don't think so no.  It could be entirely managed internally to
securityfs.

exactly.  I think struct user_namespace should have two elements gated
by a #ifdef CONFIG_SECURITYFS which are the vfsmount and the
mount_count for passing into simple_pin_fs.
