It would be interesting to know why KSM decided to replace the mapped
page with the shared zeropage instead of dropping the page and letting
the next read fault populate the shared zeropage. That code predates
userfaultfd IIRC.

Once userfaultfd (missing mode) is enabled on a VMA:

1) khugepaged will no longer collapse pte_none(pteval), independent of
khugepaged_max_ptes_none setting -- see __collapse_huge_page_isolate.
[it will also not collapse zeropages, but I recall that that's not
actually required]

So it will not close holes, because the user space fault handler is in
charge of making a decision when something will get mapped there and
with which content.


2) Page faults will no longer populate a THP -- the user space handler
is notified instead and has to decide how the fault will be resolved
(place pages).


If you unmap something (resulting in pte_none()) where previously
something used to be mapped in a page table, you might suddenly inform
the user space fault handler about a page fault that it doesn't expect,
because it previously placed a page and did not zap that page itself
(MADV_DONTNEED).

So at least with userfaultfd I think we have to be careful. Not sure if
there are other corner cases (again, KSM behavior is interesting)
