We could defer the kmalloc() that doesn't work on a zero-sized request. 
I would say thisÂ  is minor.

I have tried this now and I am looking at 4 remaining patches that need 
to somehow find its way into v8 without causing too many disturbances. 
At what point (over how many patches) can I introduce CONFIG_IMA_NS 
without anything related to IMA namespacing happening? I need it early 
in 'your 3rd part' since it is also used for conditional compilation 
(Makefile) and #ifdef's where Makefile content and what the #ifdefs are 
doing probably shouldn't be squeezed into a single patch just so it's 
all enabled in one patch, but it should probably still remain logically 
separated into different patches. Enablement of IMA namespace would be 
in the very last patch. But there may be several patches between the 
very last one and CONFIG_IMA_NS is introduced...

v7 at least, before the requirement to do late/lazy initialization, 
enabled CONFIG_IMA_NS right away and built ever step on top of it, even 
if the IMA namespace only became **configurable** in the last patch when 
securityfs was enbled and one could set a policy. From that perspective 
it would be easier to switch to late initialization in a patch on top of 
v7 but .. ok, we cannot do that.

Atomic over multiple patches? So introducing CONFIG_IMA_NS that doesn't 
do anything for several patches is still considered 'atomic' then ?
