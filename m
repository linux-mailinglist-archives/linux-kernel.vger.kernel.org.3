What happens if the lock is grabbed right after testing for it?
Shouldn't you use lockdep_assert_held() instead as the documentation
says to?

You are grabbing the lock way in this call, again, you have a window
where the check above would not have worked :(

I don't think this is fixing anything properly, sorry.
