The EFI stub carries out a bunch of actions that have meaningful 
security impact, and that's material that should be measured. Having the 
secure launch kernel execute the stub without awareness of what it does 
means it would need to measure the code without measuring the state, 
while the goal of DRTM solutions is to measure state rather than the 
code.
