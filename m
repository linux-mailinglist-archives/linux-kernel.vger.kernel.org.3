Just to let you know my plans: I was quite busy with getting the
i.MX8MP HDMI part to work. Now that this is at least in a state where
it can collect some feedback from upstream I have some time to circle
back to this topic. I can't commit to do it immediately, but I'll get
around to looking at the PCIe series a bit more in-depth and apply my
HSIO PLL suggestion to the blk-ctrl driver during the next week.

Regards,
Lucas
