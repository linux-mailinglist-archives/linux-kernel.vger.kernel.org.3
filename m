FYI: An empty file signed with pkcs7 and an ecc key for NIST p256 
generates a signature of size 817 bytes. If an RPM needs to carry such 
signatures on a per-file basis we are back to the size increase of 
nearly an RSA signature. I would say for packages this is probably too 
much size increase.. and this is what drove the implementation of ECC 
support.
