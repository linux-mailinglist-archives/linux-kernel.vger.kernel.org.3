Yes, I get your point now. Indeed it is just one soft requirement.

Emm... you are right. But here is a conflict: I must reserve resources for a
potential recovery mission, but I may hang if the user directly reboots...

What about add a systemd service?

Actually I wrote some code not included in the patchset:

(0) Now the request_queue is quiesced since we are after START_RECOVERY.

(1) mark all ubqs as 'force_abort', which makes ublk_queue_rq() fail
    all IOs before calling blk_mq_atart_request() after unqiescing
    request_queue.

(2) end(abort) all rqs inflight. Note that set of inflight does not change
    since we are quiesced.

(3) unqiesce request_queue. Note that set of inflight rqs does not change
    since we marked all ubqs as 'force_abort'. We have to unqiesce or del_gendisk()
    will hang forever(not sure I am correct).

(4) del_gendisk()

(5) complete ALL ioucmds by calling io_uring_cmd_done()

But this is really a ugly implementation since I do not consider:

(1) After START_RECOVERY, what if the new process crashes 'before' all FETCH_REQ
    cmds are sent(some ubqs are ready while others are not).

(2) After START_RECOVERY, what if the new process crashes 'after' all FETCH_REQ
    cmds are sent but 'before' END_RECOVERY.


Ming, I suggest that this could be added in a future patch because I want to make
this one simple and easy to understand :)

If you do not agree, I can add this in next version though I really think we should
be more careful.

Yes, I argee that a ublk_drv crash means the whole daemon(process) being dead
abnormally(without sending stop command).

I only consider the 'process' crash, not a single 'pthread'(ubq_daemon) crash.
The process crashes if:

(1) The user kill it(the detector can do this, the backend can do this, or the
    ublksrv_tgt can do this...)

(2) It exits because of exception(segfault, divisor error, oom...)
