I missed the root question in my first reply. I think this was
originally modeled after the memory.high interface, but I don't know
if there are other reasons. Shakeel would know better.

AFAIK this should work naturally on root as well, but I think it makes
more sense then to use a global interface (hopefully introduced soon)?
I don't have an opinion here let me know what you prefer for v2.
