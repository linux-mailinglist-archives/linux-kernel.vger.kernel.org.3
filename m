I am wondering if it could be more helpful to apply this patch on the
background services(system_server etc) than APP, while the latter ones
are persistent to the system.

As my response to Michal's comment. Userspace monitors introduce
latency. Take LMKD as an example, it is actually driven by the
PSI_POLL_PERIOD_XXX_MS after first wakeup, which means
PSI_WINDOW_SIZE_MS could be too big to rely on. IMHO, with regards to
the responding time, LMKD is less efficient than lmk driver but more
strong in strategy things. I would like to test this patch in real
android's work load and feedback in next version.
