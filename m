Hi Dan,

Ok, though I would like to try to push the conversation forwards beyond where
we got to last year. IIRC the general conclusion was that all protocols
sharing a DOE instance (and more generally because they all share
discovery) must be mediated by the kernel and that we would not be
supporting a generic access interface (there was one in a much earlier
version of this patch set).  Whilst it's far from the only thing that needs
resolving, this DOE question is also a blocker on getting anywhere with
CMA/SPDM.  Unbinding a driver as the means to stop the kernel accessing
a DOE is reliant on the host driver not deciding to do any more protocol
discovery - we can probably rely on that but it's not pretty.

This isn't really DOE ABI we are currently discussing, it's a CXL subsystem ABI.
If we decided to only expose the DOE as an internal implementation
detail (calls made directly from appropriate existing CXL driver) then
there wouldn't be an ABI question. We would be limiting DOE access
for other protocols but personally I don't see that as a problem
in the short to medium term.

Things may be more 'interesting' for the PCIe port services driver though
(see RFC just sent out)
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cxl/20220503153449.4088-1-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/T/#t
Perhaps if we can resolve what that should look like, the CXL EP side
of things will be much easier to figure out?

Great, that seems like a sensible step to do in parallel.
