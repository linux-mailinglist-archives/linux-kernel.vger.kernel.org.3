The Kconfig IMA_KEYRINGS_PERMIT_SIGNED_BY_BUILTIN_OR_SECONDARY
"help" is very clear:

        help
          Keys may be added to the IMA or IMA blacklist keyrings, if
the
          key is validly signed by a CA cert in the system built-in or
          secondary trusted keyrings.

          Intermediate keys between those the kernel has compiled in
and the
          IMA keys to be added may be added to the system secondary
keyring,
          provided they are validly signed by a key already resident in
the
          built-in or secondary trusted keyrings.
