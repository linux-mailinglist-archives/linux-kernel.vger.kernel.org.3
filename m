It will definitely break anything that relies on managed interrupts,
where the kernel expects to allocate interrupts that have a strict
affinity. Drivers using this feature can legitimately expect that they
can keep their state in per-CPU pointers, and that obviously breaks.

This may affect any PCIe device with more than a couple of queues.
Maybe users of this HW do not care (yet), but we'll have to find a way
to tell drivers of the limitation.
