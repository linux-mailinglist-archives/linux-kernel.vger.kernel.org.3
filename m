2 of these 3 are autoenum ones, one is in probe path and other in bus 
reset path during pm.

The final one is broadcast timeout, new timeout value should be okay for 
that too, given that we need 10ms timeout.

We can't do much on the timeout.

Even if enumeration timeout, we will not access the registers because 
the ASoC codec is not registered yet from WCD938x component master.

QCom hardware alteast the version based on which this driver was written 
did not have any support to report errors type back on register read/writes.

In this case a broad cast read or write did not generate a complete 
interrupt its assumed that its ignored, as there is no way to say if its 
error or ignored.
