If called by the crng_slow_load(), it's mixed into the pool but we're
not trusting it. But in crng_fast_load() we're using it to init crng.

In crng_fast_load(), the seed would be mixed to primary_crng.state[4],
and then crng_init will be 1 if the added seed is enough.
rng-seed in dt (called in early_init_dt_scan_chosen()) also needs to
use this function to init crng.

With the patch, we're seeing
[    0.000000] random: get_random_u64 called from
__kmem_cache_create+0x34/0x270 with crng_init=0

While before it should be
[    0.000000] random: get_random_u64 called from
__kmem_cache_create+0x34/0x280 with crng_init=1

Only when crng_init==0, if crng is initialized, it would continue with
credit_entropy_bits().
