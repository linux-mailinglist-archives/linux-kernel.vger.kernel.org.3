I'm not comfortable with PCI allocating memory.  Especially optionally
allocating memory.  And I'm not sure this really saves the extra queries.  The
PCI layer will have to query first to determine response length.

If the community does want PCI to allocate memory then I think the interface
should be to always allocate it.

If an FLR happens then truncation does not seem like a problem.

I'll review.  I don't think this is a fast path.

I'm ok with renaming.  Jonathan chose the names and no one has complained yet.

This was discussed a couple of times and it was decided to keep the
synchronicity out of the library functions and allow users to decide how to
handle it.

I think it depends on which driver one is considering.

Correct it is up to the higher level code to do this.

All that could be done above these calls.  I've abandoned the aux bus stuff
after discussions with Dan.  So perhaps burring this away from the CXL drivers
is a good idea.  But I still think this can serve as a base within the PCIe
code.

Again this was discussed and we settled on task.  I'm not married to the term
and s/task/exchange/ is fine with me.  But IFRC Dan was not happy with
exchange.

I could do that.  It just did not seem important enough to make it that strict.

Are you suggesting that this layer PAD the request?  I hear your concern but
users of this layer will need to understand this in the request payload
allocated anyway.

I thought Jonathan and I had work through how this was correct.  I'll have to
review those threads.

Sure if struct pci_doe_mb is moved.

Lets see how V9 looks from other perspectives.  I've incorporated some of this
feedback for V10.
