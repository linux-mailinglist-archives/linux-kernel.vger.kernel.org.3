Other than enable flag, how would you handle the defrag flag
hierarchically? It is much more complicated.

I have been involved in this kind of topic discussion offline a couple
of times. But TBH I don't see how you could achieve QoS by this flag.
THP allocation is *NOT* guaranteed. And the overhead may be quite
high. It depends on how fragmented the system is.
