What happen to this? It looks like it has fallen through the cracks. Or
was progress made and it just didn't link to the ticket or mention the
reporter?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.

Using Waydroid which is android run via LXC, on android 10 the bug comes when trying to use video playback. I know of issues on android 11 but have not yet had the chance to get the logs from it. the issue does not occur in Linux kernel 5.16 series. but does occur on linux 5.17. the issue is confirmed on both Arch's linux-zen 5.17.1.zen1-1 kernel as well as some users reporting a fedora kernel with the issue.
