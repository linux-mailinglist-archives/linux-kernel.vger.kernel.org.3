pci_iomap_range() tests the resource start, i.e., the CPU address.  I
guess the implication is that on RISC-V, the CPU-side port address is
the same as the PCI bus port address?

Is that actually a requirement?  Maybe you could also avoid this by
remapping the ports in CPU address space?

Is the same true for PCI memory addresses?  They are identical to CPU
addresses, i.e., no translation is applied?

On the PCI side, zero is a perfectly valid address, so it's a shame to
throw it away if we don't have to, especially since throwing away even
16 bytes of MMIO space means a 4GB 32-bit BAR cannot be mapped at all.
