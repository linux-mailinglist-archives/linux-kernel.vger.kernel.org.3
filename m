Makes sense.

I am afraid that is a way to hell. We might end up in doing
really crazy things if we want to complete the transition
in one minute.

The great thing about the current approach is that it tries
to livepatch the system without too much disruption. The
more we try to speed up the transition the more we might
disrupt the system. Not to say about the code complexity
and potential bugs.

IMHO a better approach is to fix your management system.
The task is done when the livepatch module is loaded.

If you want to know that there is some problem. Then the
livepatch code might write some warning when the transition
has not finished within some reasonable time frame
(1 hour or so). It might be monitored the same way
as the messages from various watchdogs, ...
