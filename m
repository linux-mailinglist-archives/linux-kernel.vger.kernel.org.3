Okay. Also, I will add this file in the MAINTAINERS file under the 
heading 'TEXAS INSTRUMENTS ASoC DRIVERS'

The dts file of arm SOCs is not updated and was generating an error in 
dtbs_check. I will remove this property.

The mcasp node in the file 'arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-sl50.dts' has this 
as child node.

Will update the description and the maximum.

For the above three properties, is the description in the txt file 
sufficient?

Some arm SOCs had additional clocks in the DT nodes.

These were mentioned in txt file as required.
In light of this new knowledge, I will remove 'serial-dir', 'op-mode' 
and 'tdm-slots'.
