Making a table for the inputs & outputs is always a easier way to get
things done, but the trade off is, as you said, extension to the table
every time for new outputs.

So do we really need all parameters to be in a table, or these are
actually the outcome of some calculation? Is it possible just
Implementing the calculation.

If I remember correctly, linux clk framework enables a generic clk
caculation mechanism. It encourages people to model the internal
refclk, plls (and deviders?) separately and construct the clk tree.
Then the specified calculation could be simpler for each clk driver.

I'm not sure the clk framework fits all your need, but please
investigate it firstly.

As usual, we firstly make clear why existing framework cannot fit the
case and should be implemented in userspace, then everything would be
OK.
