In my understanding we *always* have to walk the hierarchy upwards 
independent of nesting depth and visit all the parent namespaces so we 
don't miss anything that has happened in a child namespace and can log 
the action in the parent namespaces depending on that namespace's 
policy. It's this command line that I am concerned about that must not 
lead to concealing of running of programs in nested user namespaces from 
the init_ima_ns for example:

unshare --user --map-root-user \
   unshare --user --map-root-user \
   unshare --user --map-root-user \
   ... \
   <malware>

The malware would obviously run in the init_(pid|mnt|...)_namespace's.

Similarly this applies to running nested user namespaces that root could 
nsenter into to try to conceal the execution of programs.

So I would rather want to prevent having to walk namespaces backwards 
and encountering an ima_namespace pointer multiple times and having to 
figure out whether the evaluation of the policy of that namespace 
already occurred. I'd rather skip over user namespaces with NULL 
pointers to IMA namespaces because those have not been configured and/or 
activated, yet.
