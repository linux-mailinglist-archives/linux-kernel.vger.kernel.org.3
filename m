Are you suggesting that PTM should be left enabled if the driver
called pci_save_state(), but disabled otherwise?  I don't see the
rationale for that.

I don't understand all the paths through pci_pm_suspend_noirq() (e.g.,
skip_bus_pm), but for this one, I think we could do something like
this:

  driver_saved = pci_dev->state_saved;
  if (!driver_saved)
    pci_save_state(pci_dev);

  pci_disable_ptm(pci_dev);

  if (!driver_saved) {
    if (pci_power_manageable(pci_dev))
      pci_prepare_to_sleep(pci_dev);
  }

Or I guess one could argue that a driver calling pci_save_state() is
implicitly taking responsibility for all PCI-related suspend work, and
it should be disabling PTM itself.  But that doesn't really seem
maintainable.

The power saving is good.  I'm trying to make the argument that we
need to disable PTM on all devices for correctness.

If we disable PTM on the root port, are we guaranteed that it will
never receive a PTM Request from a downstream device?  Per PCIe r6.0,
sec 6.21.3, such a request would cause an Unsupported Request error.

I sort of expect that if we're putting a root port in a low-power
state, all downstream devices are already in the same or a lower-power
state (but I don't understand PM well enough to be confident).

And I don't really *expect* devices in a low-power state to generate
PTM Requests, but I haven't seen anything in the spec that prohibits
it.

This leads me to believe that if we disable PTM in a root port, we
must first disable PTM in any downstream devices.  Otherwise, the root
port may log UR errors if the downstream device issues a PTM Request.
