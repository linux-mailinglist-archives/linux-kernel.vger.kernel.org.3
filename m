Run fsck of course! And then recover from backups :) I know this is sad but
the situation is that our migration code just is not crash-safe (if we
crash we are going to free blocks that are still used by the migrated
inode) and Luis makes it work in case we do not crash (which should be
hopefully more common) and documents it does not work in case we crash.
So overall I'd call it a win.

But maybe we should just remove this online-migration functionality
completely from the kernel? That would be also a fine solution for me. I
was thinking whether we could somehow make the inode migration crash-safe
but I didn't think of anything which would not require on-disk format
change...
