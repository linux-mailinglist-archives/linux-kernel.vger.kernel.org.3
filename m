I think you are conflating the signatures themselves from where they are stored.
The fs-verity built-in signatures feature could be extended to support the same
signatures as IMA, while still storing the signature in the same way the
fs-verity built-in signatures are currently stored (which doesn't use xattrs).

But as I said, I don't think it makes sense to continue building on the
fs-verity built-in signatures feature, as opposed to guiding users towards a
full userspace solution or to IMA instead.
