Because pci_root.c doesn't read aspm_disabled.

Arguably, pci_root.c could look at aspm_disabled instead of looking at
the FADT flag directly.

This is about the case after failing acpi_pci_osc_control_set() and
generally we need to defer setting aspm_disabled because of
pcie_aspm_sanity_check().

Right.
