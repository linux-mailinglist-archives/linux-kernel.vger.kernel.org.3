There is at least an error in your schema, details latter on.

It could be an issue in the fixups which in general convert 
schemas for strings to string arrays and scalars/arrays to matrix. You 
have to look at processed-schema.json to debug it.

The other thing is 'oneOf' errors can be confusing in terms of error 
messages because the tooling doesn't really know which entry had the 
least error. Like the type was right, but some secondary constraint 
failed (as what's secondary is not expressed in any way).

I would debug it further, but I don't really like the end result. I 
think it's too hard to follow. For the most part, we avoid $refs at the 
property level across different schema files with the big exception 
being types.yaml. $defs are also used sparingly. The challenge is that 
json-schema by default will be silent on schemas misformed in lots of 
ways. Our meta-schema adds a lot of constraints which limits what the 
schemas can look like and ensures schemas are valid. It also allows me 
to define new constraints rather than repeat the same review comment 
over and over.

This passes only for 'reg-names = "elbi", "appl", "app";'

See the problem? Replacing the 'oneOf' above with 'items' is what you 
want. But then the schema will not allow any missing entries either. 
DBI2 is optional for example. There is no way in json-schema to define a 
list of ordered values(string) once and say some entries are optional 
which I think is what you are trying to do here.

So 'addr_space' is now valid for host mode?

(Really, for DW blocks with iATU, this should have been the whole memory 
space and the driver could size the config space itself. (IOW, the 
config region is configuration rather than h/w description.)

These should not be in any new users as the phy should be separate.

This says there is only a single interrupt entry. Same for the other 
$defs.
