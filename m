The problem is that your proposed fix:

affects both file creations as well as directory creations (mkdir).
Putting the inode on the fast commit list is something that is meant
for files, and means that on a fast commit we need to force the data
blocks out.  So it seems that isn't the right fix for the problem.

Why do something really simple?  Look at the parent directory's inode,
and check its i_sync_tid.  If it's not equal to
handle->h_transaction->t_tid, then it's safe to do the fast commit.
If it's equal to the current transaction, we can either force a full
commit.

Optionally, in the case where i_sync_tid == current tid, since there's
a chance that the parent directory's inode could have been freshly
fetched from disk (see __ext4_iget() in fs/ext4/inode.c), we could
compare its i_crtime against ktime_get_real_seconds(), and if the
inode was created in the last 2*journal->j_commit_interval/HZ seconds,
it's safe to do a fast commit; otherwise do a full commit.

Cheers,
