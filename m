The plan is that each IMA namespace will have its own rbtree with its 
own set of iints. We cannot do it all at the same time, so this will 
take while until things can be completely moved over into a per-IMA 
namespace rbtree and each IMA namespace becomes fully independent.

You mean files in general or SecurityFS files in particular?

Expand the existing commit texts, is that what you suggest that I do?

So that's a link per patch to all its previous versions?
