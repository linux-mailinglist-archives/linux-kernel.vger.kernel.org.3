Hey Ard,

Apologies for the lag in response, I wanted to have this to you sooner,
but between a variety of events and working on building consensus on how
to address your comments made it drag out a little. Before reading this
message, I would recommend reading the proposal posted to the top of
this thread, as it details an approach that builds on Matthew's callback
proposal along with addressing your concerns with measurements. In this
message, I want to provide you direct answers to the points you raised
independent of the reply at the top of this thread to help map where
your concerns influenced the proposal.

Apologies, I was not meaning to suggest this was not an option. As you
can see in the proposal posted, this approach is in fact being embraced.
It is not explicit stated in the proposal, but the approach for the
Secure Launch spec is to not explicitly dictate the location of the DL
Handler. If a firmware manufacturer wants to implement a Secure Launch
compliant DL Handler in firmware, this certainly would be welcomed, but
should not be a requirement to enable Secure Launch. For instance, in
the prototype the DL Handler is actually implemented as a stub in the
setup kernel as that is the direction we are moving towards but may not
be how the final implementation works.

IMHO that is the beauty of the Secure Launch spec. Just as you suggest,
your EFI environment shim could track what the EFI stub does and record
it in the SLRT. In addition, your shim could also implement the DL
Handler to invoke the Dynamic Launch.

As I mentioned in the Secure Launch spec proposal, it was not correct
for us to seek that the efi-stub<->kernel interface to be standardized.
The reality is that Secure Launch is an entrypoint itself and like the
efi-stub should provide an interface specifying how and what needs to be
provided to it for it to function correctly.

Agreed, which is why we went back and worked on what is the proper way
to address this problem. As has been mentioned many times, while x86 may
have the most mature Dynamic Launch capability, it is not the only
platform with Dynamic Launch. The goal for TrenchBoot is to provide a
common experience, to the extent possible, for using Dynamic Launch
across the different platforms that provide the capability. And to be
clear, that is especially true for different environments on the same
architecture. Specifically, we want setup and configuration to be the
same on x86 coreboot and x86 UEFI.

There is only a mentioning of it in the proposal, but for the Secure
Launch specification there will be a policy entry that will remove the
need for having what will be measured codified in the kernel. It will
allow measurement mechanisms to be implemented in the sl-stub and the
policy will allow the selection and configuration of the mechanisms.

I would say the scope is no less vague than it is for efi-stub. UEFI and
kernel features will increase that will change the behavior of the
kernel and affect its ability to protect information within the system.
As this changes, DRTM will need to be able to measure this expansion so
that it may be able to assert the system state/abilities to a user, a
cloud or an enterprise.

This is no longer an issue with the new proposal.

I apologize, but I read "Wouldn't it be better for the secure launch
kernel to boot the EFI entrypoint directly?" to mean that you would be
looking for EFI entrypoint to be called by the Dyanmic Launch. If that
is the case, then again I am not sure how you would make this work as is
suggested.

Let me clarify a little further on how Dynamic Launch hardware works.
When the Dynamic Launch CPU instruction is called by the preamble, the
system enters a new type of execution state, on Intel it is literally a
separate CPU mode referred to as SMX. A very simplistic way to think of
this is that the system has gone through a soft warm boot, but
everything is now different. Instead of coming in through the reset
vector, the system will jump to the DLME entrypoint that was registered
during the preamble. There will be DMA protections in place protecting
the regions specified during the preamble, and the CPU will function in
a slightly different manner. For instance the AP rendezvous procedure
has to be done differently, if a standard INIT-SIPI-SIPI rendezvous is
attempted the system will fault. In the end, this is done to ensure to
the best ability that the system is in a proper state and the only
software executing is that which was measured by the CPU. It is a bit
impressive what the CPU does, and for Intel CPUs there is a fair amount
of detail documented under the SDM documentation for GETSEC[SENTER] [1].
This is one of the reasons there is a fair bit of assembly in the secure
launch patch series, as there is a very specific way in which the system
needs to be brought up from the minimal state it is left in by the
GETSEC[SENTER] instruction to a state that the setup kernel is able to
take control.

This might be made to work by making this EFI shim capable of being
entered by the Dynamic Launch and then call into the efi-stub. But tbh
this is a non-starter from our perspective as this would then force all
x86 environments to run this EFI shim, specifically coreboot
environments. Just as Linux-EFI is not being pushed to work like a
non-efi environment for Dynamic Launch, it would not be fair to force
non-EFI environments to function like an EFI environment.

As suggested above, under the Secure Launch spec proposal, the EFI shim
would work very well as a preamble environment that implements the
Secure Launch spec.

Agreed, which is why just as efi-stub has its entry interface that every
bootmanager/bootloader must implement, the sl-stub is an entrypoint that
will implement the Secure Launch specification for how it should be
entered, whether that is by efi-stub or an EFI shim underneath efi-stub.
