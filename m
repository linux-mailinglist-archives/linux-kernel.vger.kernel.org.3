You might also send the patch and just mention that you were not able
to test it on powerpc. There are people with access to powerpc that
might check it.

Another question is how to actually test it. I wonder how you do
it for x86.

Finally, also s390 supports livepatching. I guess that the problem is
there as well. Is is straightforward to write the revert code, please?
