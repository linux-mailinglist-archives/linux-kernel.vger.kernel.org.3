For the bridge in runtime D3cold we still need to power it up. I considered and tested this on the platform
supported D3hot only. Under D3hot state the configuration space is still accessible and the brigde will be
powered up when scanning children, but under D3cold we'll fail to read the bus number here. Will fix it.
