Yes, thought I had checked this but having just gone back and booted
things again, the following is observed:

- U-Boot "pci enum" and then unpatched kernel -> link 8GT/s
- U-Boot "pci enum" and patched kernel -> link 2.5GT/s
- U-Boot no pci and patched kernel > link 2.5 GT/s

Clearly there needs to be some fix for this, either have two rounds
of soft-reset on the first probe, or if the device does probe at a
degraded link, do something about it.

I am not clear what the correct fix for this is.

1) Detect no U-Boot initialisation and force a two stage probe
2) If no devices on initial probe, go around and do #1
3) Always do a two stage reset
4) Something else.

Do any other systems see this issue?

I assume we need to go back and re-do this. At least this is a 100%
reliable repeat on the Unmatched board in our test rack.

Thanks, useful to know.

Ok.

Will fix.

Yeah, this does not make sense now. I sort of assumed it was W1C
type thing (write-1-clear). I'm just wondering if this is now some
sort of undefined behaviour or they originally meant to clear out
some bits only... It does work, just shows the following from lspci;

L0s <4us, L1 <4us
          ClockPM- Surprise- LLActRep+ BwNot- ASPMOptComp+
  LnkCtl: ASPM Disabled; RCB 64 bytes, Disabled- CommClk+
         ExtSynch- ClockPM- AutWidDis- BWInt- AutBWInt-
   LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded), Width x8 (ok)
