If you look at the changes to sbitmap at:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/lib/sbitmap.c

you'll find that they are relatively recent, so Yukai's patch will probably also apply
to 5.18 - I don't know. Also look at the most recent commit which mentions
"Checking free bits when setting the target bits. Otherwise, it may reuse the busying bits."

Reusing the busy bits sounds "not great" either and (AFAIU) may also be a cause for
lost wakeups, but I'm sure Jan and Ming know all that better than me.

Especially Jan's suggestions re. disabling BFQ cgroup support is probably the easiest
thing to try first. What you're observing may not have a single root cause, and even if
it does, it might not be where we suspect.
