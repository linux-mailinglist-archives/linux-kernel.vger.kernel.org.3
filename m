By grouping everything into "the rework of get_random_*()", you miss
important subtleties, as I mentioned before. Importantly, in this case,
the issue we're facing has absolutely nothing at all to do with that,
but is rather entirely the result of removing the async notifier
mechanism in favor of doing things more directly, more straight
forwardly. So let's not muddle what we're discussing here.

But more generally, the RNG is supposed to be usable from any context.
And adding wild workarounds, or worse, adding back complex async
notifier stuff, seems bad. So far your proposals for the printk issue
haven't been acceptable at all.

So why don't we actually fix this, so we don't have to keep coming up
with hacks? The question is: does using raw spinlocks over this code
result in any real issue for RT latency? If so, I'd like to know where,
and maybe I can do something about that (or maybe I can't). If not, then
this is a non problem and I'll apply this patch with your blessing.

If you don't want to spend time doing latency measurements, could you
instead share a document or similar to the type of methodology you
usually use for that, so I can do the same? And at the very least, I am
simply curious and want to know more about the RT world.

Jason
