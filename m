Ah, I guess I didn't look too closely at the selftest.

But inlining and isra are inherently different from this.  They affect
static functions, which the compiler knows all the callers and is free
to (and does) tweak the ABI.  The compiler (and the patch author)
definitively know all the callers.

If child_func() happens to be a global function, it could be called from
anywhere.  Even from another klp_object.  If there are a lot of callers
across the kernel, there would be a proliferation of corresponding
stack_only funcs.

It could also be called from a function pointer, which levels up the
difficulty.

Regardless I'm thinking the above approach should be flexible enough.

If the patched child_func no longer has .cold, set 'new_name' to NULL in
the stack_only entry.

If the original child_func doesn't have .cold, but patched child_func
does, set 'old_name' to NULL in the stack_only entry.

If there were ever more than one of such "sub-functions" (which I
believe currently doesn't happen), the author could create multiple
stack_only entries.

kpatch-build has checks for symbols with ".cold" substring.  I'm
thinking it would be easy enough for you to do something similar since
you're already checking for other compiler optimizations.

Urgh, this is starting to give me a headache.

Could we put the cold funcs in a klp_ops func_stack to make this work
automatically?

Alternatively we could link the .cold functions to their non-cold
counterparts somehow.  So when checking a function's stack, also check
it's linked counterpart.  It could even be part of the original
function's klp_func struct somehow, rather than having a dedicated
klp_func struct for the stack_only thing.

Or we could just give up trying to abstract this entirely, and go back
to Peter's suggestion to just always look for a ".cold" version of every
function in klp_check_stack_func() :-)

I dunno...

Same here.
