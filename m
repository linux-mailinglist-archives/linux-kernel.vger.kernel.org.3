Good to know, but if there are upstream dts files, what do they use?

While in general I consider the order part of the ABI, if that's
enough to avoid breakage on anything you care about, then just state
that.

Only if that's what you need. If you are fine with the order changing,
then make the change and fix all the dts files.

I don't disagree. I'm only asking for a better commit message.
