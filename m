Thanks, Christian, Stefan.

Reviewed-by: Mimi Zohar <zohar@linux.ibm.com>

This change is really independent of the IMA namespacing.  Based on
Greg's request of unification of where platform specific
variables/keys/etc are stored, the consensus so far seems to be
'securityfs/secrets'.  Although this patch isn't a bug fix, let's try
and get this upstreamed.

The current securityfs usages are apparmor, lockdown, safesetid,
tomoyo, core LSM ("security/lsm"), and the TPM.

Only on failure to create securityfs files or directories, are
previously created securityfs files/directories removed.  The one
exception seems to be the TPM, which may be built as a kernel module.

thanks,

Mimi
