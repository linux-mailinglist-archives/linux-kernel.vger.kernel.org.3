Why is this a resend?  I see
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20220305051105.725838-1-lizhi.hou@xilinx.com,
which looks like it was posted just a few minutes before this.  I
assume this "RESEND" is identical?

s/pci/PCI/ (capitalize acronyms above, also in other subjects, commit
logs, and code comments)

s/PCIe/PCI/ (in most cases, the above is not PCIe-specific)

Please add blank lines between paragraphs to make this easier to read.

The above tells *what* this series does, but not *why* we need it.

Apparently you want to describe PCI BARs in DT.  Normally the PCI core
discovers devices and BARs using the PCI enumeration process (read
config space looking for a Device ID, read standard BAR locations
(unimplemented BARs are hardwired to zero)).  Obviously you know all
of this.  What we need here (and in the commit log for the relevant
patch) is some explanation about why this standard process doesn't
work and you need to do something via DT.

I'm guessing this is for the case where Linux is running *on* the
endpoint, so instead of enumerating devices from the perspective of a
PCI host controller, it's on the "other" side of the device, e.g., as
described in Documentation/PCI/endpoint/pci-endpoint.rst

So the commit log should mention that and explain why we need this new
DT support.  The endpoint support has been around for a while, so this
should explain what's different about Xilinx Alveo and why it needs
this new stuff.
