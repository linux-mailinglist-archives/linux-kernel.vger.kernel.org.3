To prevent patching, it would need to be some kind of sustained CPU
activity, rather than a burst.  I guess we haven't seen that show up as
a real-world problem until now.

If you're able to identify which kthreads would be problematic, then
yeah, defining a "transition point" in their outer loops could be an
option.

We could look also at a more general approach, like stack checking from
an irq handler.  But as Petr alluded to, that would be problematic for
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER.

We could maybe deprecate frame pointers on x86 for live patching, but I
think other arches would have a similar problem unless they were to do
something like the ORC unwinder.
