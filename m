Ah, I had not seen that email. Quoting from there:

This is probably a question for Rob as the mvebu driver is a rather special
case. Normally this would just be a 'reg' property of the host bridge,
but I think
in your case the root device is imaginary, and the ports under it are the
actual hardware devices, so you'll probably have to do the same thing as
the armada-385, translating the mbus ranges for the config space in the
"ranges" property of the parent, and then referring to them by PCI
MMIO addresses using the assigned-addresses property to pass the
config-space registers as a second set of registers in addition to the
first set.

Ok. It should not be hard to do this first, as you just need to pass the
same physical address that you pass in the mbus setup, but I agree
it's easier to do this afterwards to avoid having to rewrite it again.

Ok. This is probably not worth the effort if the old driver doesn't already
do provide access to the high registers.
