The main problem is we have no vfsmount and we can't create one in
there because the fill super is triggered by the vfsmount creation for
the actual mount.  It's all done under the sb->s_umount semaphore.

I think we might get it to work if we keep the root dentry in the
securityfs namespace entries instead of the vfsmount; I'll investigate.
