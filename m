But e500v2 is 2.03 and not older than 2.00...

I looked also in e500v2 and P2020 errata documents there is nothing
mentioned about eh flag. But it looks like a bug.

Probably yes.

But most people on these machines are using stable LTS kernels and do
not upgrade too often.

So you need to wait longer time to see people starting reporting such
bugs. Need to wait at least when v4.14 and v4.19 LTS versions stops
receiving updates. v4.19 is used in Debian 10 (oldstable) and v5.4 is
used by current OpenWRT. Both distributions are still supported, so
users have not migrated to new v5.15 problematic kernel yet.
