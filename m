I'm not sure what you expect me to say here. You have a device that
references an interrupt. The DT seems sound (I don't get why you think
"interrupt-extended" is a problem here, but hey...).

If your kernel doesn't have a driver for the interrupt controller
referenced here, what do you expect, other than things not working?

Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.
