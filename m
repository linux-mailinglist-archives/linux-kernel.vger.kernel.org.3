Hi, Paolo

Thanks for your explanation.

My orginal thoughts was using weights_tree insertion/removal, however,
Jan convinced me that using bfq_add/del_bfqq_busy() is ok.

 From what I see, when bfqq dispatch the last request,
bfq_del_bfqq_busy() will not be called from __bfq_bfqq_expire() if
idling is needed, and it will delayed to when such bfqq get scheduled as
in-service queue again. Which means the weight of such bfqq should still
be considered in the weights_tree.

I also run some tests on null_blk with "irqmode=2
completion_nsec=100000000(100ms) hw_queue_depth=1", and tests show
that service guarantees are still preserved on slow device.

Do you this is strong enough to cover your concern?

Thanks,
Kuai
