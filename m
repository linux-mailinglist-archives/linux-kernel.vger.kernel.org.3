I had thought about this also but the rationale was:

securityfs is compiled due to CONFIG_IMA_NS and the user namespace 
exists there and that has a pointer now to ima_namespace, which can have 
that callback. I assumed that other namespaced subsystems could also be 
reached then via such a callback, but I don't know.

I suppose any late filesystem init callchain would have to be connected 
to the user_namespace somehow?

What I don't like about the fill_super is that it gets called too early:

[   67.058611] securityfs_ns_create_mount @ 102 target user_ns: 
ffff95c010698c80; nr_extents: 0
[   67.059836] securityfs_fill_super @ 47  user_ns: ffff95c010698c80; 
nr_extents: 0

We are switching to the target user namespace in 
securityfs_ns_create_mount. The expected nr_extents at this point is 0, 
since user_ns hasn't been configured, yet. But then security_fill_super 
is also called with nr_extents 0. We cannot use that, it's too early!

Ok, I can make this disappear.

fill_super would only work for the init_user_ns from what I can see.

I guess I would need to know how fill_super would work or how it could 
be called late/delayed as well.

Is there then no need to pass a separate vfsmount * in anymore? Where 
would the vfsmount pointer reside? For now it's in ima_namespace, but it 
sounds like it should be in a more centralized place? Should it also be 
connected to the user_namespace so we can pick it up using get_user_ns()?
