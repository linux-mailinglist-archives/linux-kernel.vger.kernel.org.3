I noticed that unfortunately.

Acked.

Ok, that is actually possible on a system that is given a device-tree
by the bootloader. But on a system that is desrcibed using ACPI (such
as the x86), this is much more difficult (at least to my knowledge)...
We want this feature to be easy to use for the end user. Adding such
configuration which also differs between various architecture is
clearly not so easy to setup.

Moreover, since the PCI is meant to be "Plug and Play", such
configuration would completely break that. If the user switches the
PCIe card from one slot to another, the bootloader configuration will
need to be modified. This seems a big no way for me (and for the user).

Agreed, on that fact, it did raised some eyebrows, and it was for that
specific concern that initially, I proposed the fwnode solution.
Honestly, the fwnode conversion represent a lot of work (hundreds of
lines easily) + requires a conversion of all the subsystem that are not
fwnode ready (spoiler: almost all of them are not ready).=20

After implementing Rob's solution, the device-tree overlay really seems
the cleaner to me and requires much less modifications.

Ok, thanks for your time !
