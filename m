The problem is this is before the PCI objects are created, so those 
wouldn't work since they expect to be called on a pci_dev and such.

I thought the PCIE_LINK_WIDTH_SPEED_CONTROL thing had to be set later, 
but trying it now I realized we were missing a bit of initialization 
that was causing it not to work. Indeed it can be done there and we can 
drop it from the kernel.

We could even do the max-link-speed thing in m1n1 if we want. It has 
access to the value from the ADT directly, which to be correct we'd have 
to dynamically transplant to the DT, since there's at least one device 
that has different PCIe devices on one port depending on hardware 
variant, while sharing a devicetree. If we're okay with the kernel just 
not implementing this feature for now, we can say it's the bootloader's job.

Ultimately we ship the DTs along with m1n1, so there's an argument that 
if some day we need to override the max-link-speed for whatever reason 
over what the ADT says, well, we'd be shipping the updated DT along with 
m1n1 anyway, so we might as well make m1n1 do it... if so, it might make 
sense to drop those properties from the actual DTs we ship altogether, 
at least for now.

If we decide to make it m1n1's job entirely, we can drop this patch 
altogether, at least for now (I can't say how this will interact with 
suspend/resume and other power management, and hotplug... but we'll open 
that can of worms when we get there).
