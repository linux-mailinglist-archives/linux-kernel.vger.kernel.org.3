Yesterday I tried to get this series working on my 8MP-EVK board, but
was unsuccessful for now. The PCIe link does not come up. PCIe REF_CLK
is present and PERST de-asserted. I'm not sure if this is due to a
faulty EP device (I don't have another M.2 KeyE device around to check)
or if this may be due to the old revision of my 8MP-EVK, as I'm still
working with a RevA board. The schematic revision log doesn't show
anything that would obviously influence PCIe operation, but I have also
not found any schematics for RevA.

Do you know if there have been any PCIe related changes/fixes in the
later EVK board revisions?

For now I'll try to get this working on a custom i.MX8MP board, where I
can use a different EP device. Maybe I'll have a bit more luck there.

Regards,
Lucas
