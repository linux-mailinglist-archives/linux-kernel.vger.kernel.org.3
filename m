My comment about local_lock/unlock is just a note that 
local_irq_disable/enable() have to be eventually replaced. However, we 
need to think carefully where to put the newly added local_lock. It is 
perfectly fine to keep it as is and leave the conversion as a future 
follow-up.

Thank you very much for your work on this patchset.
