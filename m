hi,

I will fix the "blank line" issues.

We try not to add any kind of logic in the CvP driver to read
or understand the correctness of the bitstream. In future, this
logic may change. The CvP driver to our best interest should
only be responsible to perform the transfer of the bitstream
and perform the respective handshake. We have plans to have
the CvP firmware on the other side be more intelligent to 
handle errors and inform the CvP driver on why a certain 
configuration session fails. We are in the process of making
the next generation CvP to close this gaps.

The block size of 4096bytes containts headers and signatures that
comprise a bitstream to FPGA. Any of the missing pieces will 
cause the FPGA configuration to fail at the SDM (Secure device
manager). We are at Intel are just trying to avoid a user from
using a bad data to reconfigure the FPGA via CvP and then, hitting
into a fault that is non-recoverable. Only a hard-reboot of the 
entire system can undo it. 

> If the image size is larger than 1 Page but is not aligned to 1 Page,
> will the reprogramming still fail?
Yes, the reconfiguration will fail. The above tear-down  is to prevent
that CvP Hardware/firmware in the FPGA from entering into a dead-lock.


>> +		memcpy(conf->send_buf, data, len);

>Any padding value is OK?
Yes, any padding value is fine. The reason for this is that, the
CvP Firmware/Hardware on the other side is using DMA to perform
transfers of 4096bytes. The firmware will wait forever for the
DMA to complete. The firmware is not able to check for status
or respond to any errors while in the wait state. 

>> +		altera_cvp_send_block(conf, (const u32 *)conf->send_buf,
>> +				      conf->priv->block_size);

>If the len equals block_size, is the copy still needed?
Actually, not required. But to maintain a simple design, we use
a common flow for all so you can skip the check.

>> +	ret = altera_read_config_dword(conf, VSE_CVP_STATUS, &val);
>> +	if (ret || (val & VSE_CVP_STATUS_CFG_ERR)) {
>> +		dev_err(&mgr->dev, "CVP_CONFIG_ERROR!\n");

>So this new error checking covers the previous "latched error" case?
Yes, because the new feature requires for the CvP driver to 
be able to subsequently re-perform a fresh new CvP session after
an error. With the above, the CvP driver will forever report
an error and caused the entire CvP to be permanently in error. 
This is not desirable and the user would need to power-cycle the
or hard reboot the entire system to recover. Intel sees this as
a terrible user-experience espcially as CvP is performed 
normally remotely.

>> +	/* Allocate the 4096 block size transmit buffer */
>> +	conf->send_buf = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, conf->priv->block_size, GFP_KERNEL);

>If block_size == ALTERA_CVP_V1_SIZE, the copy is still needed?
Yes, the firmware and hardware on the other side uses DMA
and V1 to my understanding has a smaller buffer size. Intel 
later improved this and introduced a new back-pressure credit 
data flow control to help increase the performance.

>> +	if (!conf->send_buf) {
>> +		ret = -ENOMEM;
>> +		goto err_unmap;
>> +	}

>Maybe it is better move the buffer allocation to write_init()
The altera_cvp_conf has not been created yet at this point.
The init routine in CvP so far just registers the driver.
