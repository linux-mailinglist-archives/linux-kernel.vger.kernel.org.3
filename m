Oh hm. Are you sure it's the OSC call that breaks it? I have some 
recollection that I verified the behaviour of Windows here, but it's 
been over 10 years since I touched this so I could well be wrong. I can 
try to set up a test env to verify the behaviour of Windows when it 
comes to _OSC if the FADT says ASPM is unsupported.
