From  the "ima: Move delayed work queue and variables into
ima_namespace" patch description: 
   Since keys queued up for measurement currently are only relevant in
   the init_ima_ns, call ima_init_key_queue() only when the init_ima_ns
   is initialized.

When IMA_QUEUE_EARLY_BOOT_KEYS is not enabled, ima_should_queue_key()
simply returns false.  Why do the keys workqueue need to be namespaced?
Is this preparatory for some future IMA namespacing?

thanks,

Mimi
