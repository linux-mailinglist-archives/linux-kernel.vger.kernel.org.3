This all looks reasonable but it is not clear to me what a 'Linux
setup kernel' is, and what the boot protocol is for that handover.

The EFI stub to core kernel handover ABI is private to Linux,
architecture specific, and subject to change. This is basically the
point I made before: if you want to boot Linux in EFI mode, you have
to go via the EFI stub, and the EFI stub is in charge of booting the
kernel proper. This is why I (we?) suggested some kind of callback
mechanism, where the EFI stub makes a D-RTM specific call after EBS(),
but does regain control over the boot flow.

If we add another entry point into the kernel proper for the Secure
Launch Entry component to use, we are again exposing an internal ABI
in a way that limits our future ability to make changes to the EFI <->
kernel handover.

Given that this is EFI, I would expect all these implementation
details to be exposed via a protocol that the stub can invoke, in a
way that will likely be similar (or the same?) as the TCG protocol
used for recording PCR measurements.

So could you elaborate on the types of actions? Is this simply things
like the command line, initrd contents, initrd load address, kernel
load address etc etc? There isn't generally that much going on in the
stub beyond that.
