So we would then leave it up to the one building the kernel to select 
the proper compile time options (suggested ones being IMA_WRITE_POLICY 
and IMA_READ_POLICY being enabled?) and behavior of host and IMA 
namespace is then the same per those options? Removing the file didn't 
seem the problem to me but more like whether the host should ever behave 
differently from the namespace.
