+ AMD SEV folks as they're going to probably need something like that
too.

Thanks for that detailed use case, btw!

What I'm not really sure too is, is per-node granularity ok? I guess it
is but let me ask it anyway...

Same question for SEV folks - do you guys think this interface would
make sense for the SEV side of things?

And I think some of those might be of interest to the AMD side of things
too.

Thx.
