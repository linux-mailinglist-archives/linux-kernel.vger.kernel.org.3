Hi Martin and Jeromeï¼Œ
	Thank you very much for your reply. I have learned a lot from your

I couldn't agree with you more. I have verified it on a 64-bit S4 
platform. Please refer to the attachment for verification output 
information.
I will prepare the second version of patch according to the example 
ideas you provided.
