All controls in cgroup v2 should be hierarchical. This is really
required for a proper delegation semantic.

I am not really sure I understand. If this is one application per
container (cgroup) then why do you really need per-group setting?
Does the application is a set of different processes which are only very
loosely tight?

It is still not really clear to me how do you achieve that the whole
workload in the said container has the same THP requirements.
