Making this information better is valuable! The data is autogenerated
by these scripts:
https://github.com/intel/event-converter-for-linux-perf
From data here:
https://download.01.org/perfmon/
In a way the files that are in the tree are temporary build files.
Perhaps we can have the original source and scripts within the Linux
tools tree to simplify fixes like these.

Thanks,
Ian
