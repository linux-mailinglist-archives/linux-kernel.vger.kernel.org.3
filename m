Thanks!  (Or the canonical permanent URL:

I really don't understand what "core_init_notifier" does, but it seems
incidental to this issue.  Is there really a connection?  It sounds
like the only reason to check for it is to limit the scope of the
change, not because DBI access is inherently related to
core_init_notifier.

Maybe Vidya's patch needs some enhancement to cover other paths where
DBI may be accessed before we're ready?
