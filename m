s/AM654 RootComplex/The AM654 Root Complex/

But Root Complexes are not normally materialized as PCI devices with
their own bus/device/function address, config space, BARs, etc.
Sounds like this might really be a Root *Port*, not a Root Complex?

This doesn't seem to quite answer Lorenzo's question.  On AM654, does
__pci_read_base() discover the 1MB size correctly for both RC and EP
mode?

What value should BAR0 contain in RC mode?  Does the device respond at
that address?  Do we still need to ensure that 1MB address space is
not assigned to any other device?

We have several quirks that set dev->no_msi.  Maybe that would be a
better way to prevent use of MSI-X (it would also prevent use of MSI;
not sure whether that needs to be avoided as well)?

I guess this implies that this device (RP?  I don't think RCs have
BARs) never responds to PCI address space described by BAR0?

If BAR0 should not exist at all as far as the OS is concerned, I think
you should just set r->flags = 0.  But that assumes the device never
uses the value in the BAR, and it never responds using whatever
address is there, even when PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY is set.
