The way you describe it, it does hang. This would not be recommended on 
actual projects.

At present, AmLogic chips are older than S4 Soc, and we have no way to 
deal with this problem. We have to tell customers not to use it in this 
wayã€‚Customers rarely use it in real projects.On the S4 SOC we will use 
a clock like the UART pclk to control the shutdown using two registers, 
one safe (need to operate in EL3) and one normal (EL1). It will only be 
closed if both registers are closed. This mainly prevents misoperation.

With your experience, I'd like to know how you deal with this kind of 
problem.

I'm sorry, I did branch confirm there was a mistake, I have corrected.
