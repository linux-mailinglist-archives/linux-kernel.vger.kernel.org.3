Do you mean this is x86, commit c05cd79750fb
("x86/boot/KASLR: Prefer mirrored memory regions for the kernel physical address").
This scenario is not considered.

Thanks for your incoming patch.

You are right fake_mem stuff is not going to work. But, efi_fake_mem is
used for testing mirrored features and will not be used in production
environment. This test features can fake memory's attribute values.

The reason why efi_fake_mem support is put first is that memory's attribute
is reported by BIOS which is hard to simulate. With this support, any arm64
machines with efi support can easily test mirrored features.

Yes, you're absolutely right. Efi_fake_mem is incompatible with kdump which
will use kexec. But we can remove specify cmdline(efi_fake_mem=xx) by
modofing /etc/sysconfig/kdump. Efi_fake_mem is only used for testing and
will not be used in production environment.

Can you be clear what the issues are?

The main purpose of this patchset is to introduce mirrored support for
arm64 and we have already fixed the problems we had which is shown in
patch #5 to patch #7 and try to bring total isolation in patch #8 which
will disable mirror feature if kernelcore is not specified.

Thanks for reviewing.
