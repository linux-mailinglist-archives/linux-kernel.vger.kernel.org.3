You are right, adding NUMA access statistics does make the PA & VA codes 
look confusingã€‚

Thanks for your advice, I will implement these in the next version, But 
from my understanding or maybe

I didn't get what you were thinking, I think only one monitor context is 
needed for NUMA Local & Remote,

Do not need a separate implementation like "numa_local_ops" and 
"numa_remote_ops", just set "numa_access_ops" is ok.
