Ah, that makes things make a LOT more sense!  Please add something
about "the '-gpios' suffix" for non-experts like me who don't know the
inner workings of the GPIO core.

The GPIO core seems slightly too helpful here -- we have to know about
that detail to write error messages that make sense.

Sounds good, thanks.
