"... it may be harmful for devices that are left in D0" -- I want to
understand this better.  It sounds like nvme_suspend() leaves the
device in some device-specific low-power flavor of D0, and subsequent
config accesses take it out of that low-power situation?  

If that's the case, it sounds a little brittle.  I don't think it's
obvious that "pci_dev->state_saved was set by the driver" means "no
config accesses allowed in pci_pm_suspend_noirq()."  And
pci_pm_suspend_noirq() calls quirks via pci_fixup_device(), which are
very likely to do config accesses.

Maybe PTM needs to be disabled earlier, e.g., in pci_pm_suspend()?  I
don't think PTM uses any interrupts, so there's probably no reason
interrupts need to be disabled before disabling PTM.
