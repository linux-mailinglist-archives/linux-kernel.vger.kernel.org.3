Events are generated for CascadeLake Server v1.15 with
events from:
https://download.01.org/perfmon/CLX/

Using the scripts at:
https://github.com/intel/event-converter-for-linux-perf/

This change updates descriptions, adds INST_DECODED.DECODERS and
corrects a counter mask in UOPS_RETIRED.TOTAL_CYCLES.
