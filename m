Mostly I (or someone at Google) will follow-up with patches to add
most of these features. We just wanted to get consensus on the bare
minimum interface first, and to avoid derailing this discussion with
whether or not we need each of those features and what the best way to
implement them is.

The main use case, as Wei mentioned, is memcg-based proactive demotion
via the reclaim-based demotion
mechanism in the kernel. We can still have a nodemask argument to the
global reclaim interface as well.
