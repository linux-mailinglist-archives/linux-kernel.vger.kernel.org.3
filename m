The reason is simple though: for all the detractors and whining, no-
one's actually been able to come up with a more usable replacement. 
Very few people who complain about GPG actually submit patches to fix
it.  A few come up with their own infrastructure which tends to have
even more problems.

Please, no, use universally supported crypto that we can use TPM
hardware for, which for EC currently means P-256.  It may be possible
to get the TCG and the other security bodies to add Edwards signatures
but the rate of progression of quantum means that Grover's Algorithm
will likely get there first and we'll need P-521 or X448.

Heh, this is the classic cryptographers dilemma: go for something
pejorative which can be minimal but which has only a relatively small
set of possible use cases and no future proofing or go for something
extensible which ends up more complex and others then criticize as
being a "swiss army knife".
