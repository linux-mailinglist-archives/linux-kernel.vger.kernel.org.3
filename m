Right now L1SS isn't reprogrammed after S3, and that causes WD NVMe
starts to spew lots of AER errors.
So yes please restore L1SS upon resume. Meanwhile I am asking vendor
_why_ restoring L1SS is crucial for it to work.

I also wonder what's the purpose of pcie_aspm_pm_state_change()? Can't
we just restore ASPM bits like other configs?
