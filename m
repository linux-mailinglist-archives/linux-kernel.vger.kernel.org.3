fake_mem support on arm64 will be removed in subsequent version.

Sorry I am not familiar with this, as you metioned before,

Do you mean this is x86, commit c05cd79750fb
("x86/boot/KASLR: Prefer mirrored memory regions for the kernel physical address").
I will do some research.

Does this bootloader refer to grub and then add minimal logic to arm64-stub.c?

What is the loader signal?
System exists mirrored memory reported by uefi?

Thanks for reviewing, sorry for my ignorance on this.
