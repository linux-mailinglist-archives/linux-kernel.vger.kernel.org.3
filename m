We could keep this the same for this patch but I think for jailhouse
(patch 2) we need the "!dev" case not to fail here such that we can
handle the missing function 0 below even if ARI is enabled. For s390
this doesn't currently matter because pci_ari_enabled(bus) is always
false but I assumed that this isn't necessarily so for jailhouse. I
sent a follow up mail on a slight behavior change I can think of for
this case for v2 but forgot to send it also for v3. Quoted below:

"This part here theoretically changes the behavior slightly. If the ARI
information is wrong/lands us in a "hole" we may look for more
functions via the non-ARI path. Not sure if that is relevant though as
in the worst case we might find functions that we otherwise wouldn't
have seen. Seems rather obsure to me but I might be wrong, we currently
don't see the ARI capability in Linux on IBM Z so I have less
experience with this. I did of course boot test on my x86_64
workstation."

This isn't a change to the test. It's the negation of the logical
condition *and* a switch of the branches i.e. keeps the overall
behavior exactly the same. The equivalence is !(!A || B) =3D=3D (A && !B).
There are two reasons I did this.

1. I find (!dev || dev->multifunction) to be much harder to grasp than
(dev && !dev->multifunction).

2. The whole next_fn() in my opinion becomes easier to read if it bails
for all bad cases early and the "this is the next fn" is the final
return if we didn't bail. This becomes even more true as another
condition is added in patch 2.

Yes with function 0 handled in the loop we can't use 0 as the
termination indication. Also I find it generally weird to use a wrap
around for this.

I think this is equivalent to the ternary at the return. Both return
-ENODEV for fn >=3D 7. I do like your idea better though as it keeps with
the scheme of my point 2 above and ternaries are ever so slightly
harder to read.

Yes pretty much only that by negating the success case and switching
the branches we end up with a list of fail/bail checks and a single
success return even with the hyperisor check added. Also not sure if
the "fn >=3D 7" check should rather go after the ARI path to keep them
separate doesn't really matter of course.

Yes

I agree this can probably be improved. I'm trying to say that dev can
be NULL if it is not function 0 which must exist. Maybe:

"dev may be NULL as multifunction devices may be non-contiguous but a
function 0 is required"

I agree about the "fn =3D=3D 0", I only used "!fn" because I remember
getting checkpatch warnings for "foo =3D=3D 0" in the past. I'll change to
fn =3D=3D 0. As for the order see below.

>=20

Yes. This is "dev may be NULL unless we're looking at function 0". The
fn came before dev because I wrote it as "function 0 must not be NULL"
but it could also be "dev is NULL and we're looking at function 0",
I have no clear preference.

This is also the case that gets changed by patch 2 to become:

"function 0 must not be NULL unless we have isolated PCI functions"

or with the order switched:

"dev is NULL and we're looking at function 0 and don't have isolated
PCI functions"

Hmm, I see your point. It makes little sense to have a devfn that isn't
from PCI_DEVFN(slot, 0) and not use pci_scan_single_device() instead.
