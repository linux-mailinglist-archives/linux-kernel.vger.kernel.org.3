Yeah, I had a vague memory that that was the case - basically if you can 
trust the command line as much as the config then it's definitely 
redundant to pass an option for this (see iommu_subsys_init() - it's now 
all plumbed through iommu_def_domain_type), and if you can't then 
passing them is futile anyway.

Cheers,
Robin.
