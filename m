Understood, I'll take a read through and re-submit the patch to honor the
norms for Linux kernel patches. My sincere apologies for the noise, and
thank you for the positive and constructive suggestions.

Ugh, good point and thank you for catching that. Another problem with the
current patch is that we'll call kobject_put() on the patch even if we
never call kobject_init on the patch due to patch->objs being NULL.

Perhaps we should pull try_module_get() and the NULL check for patch->objs
out of klp_init_patch_early()? It feels a bit more intuitive to me if
klp_init_patch_early() were only be responsible for initializing kobjects
for the patch and its objects / funcs anyways.

Testing it locally seems to work fine. Let me know if this sounds
reasonable to you, and I'll send out a v2 patch with the fixes to both the
patch description, and logic.

- David
