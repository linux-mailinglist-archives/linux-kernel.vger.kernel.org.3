Your initial patch set indicated that you were addressing Linus'
request to allow end-users the ability "to add their own keys and sign
modules they trust".  However, from the design of the previous patch
set and now this one, everything indicates a lot more is going on than
just allowing end-users to add their own keys.  There would be no
reason for loading all the MOK keys, rather than just the CA keys, onto
the "machine" keyring.  Please provide the motivation for this design.

Please note that Patch 6/7 permits intermediary CA keys, without any
mention of it in the cover letter.  Please include this in the
motivation for this design.

thanks,

Mimi
