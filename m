Thanks for taking the time to reviewing it.

Yeah, I did something like that in a previous version. Altough I
wasn't really happy with that.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-efi/20220113213027.457282-4-martin.fernandez@eclypsium.com/

I think that with the struct with the function arguments looks more
clear than what I did, but you have to take into account that I need
to create yet
another function similar to those and another parameter to the struct,
and with that I think that __e820__range_update will look scary.

I'll give it a try anyway!
