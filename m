Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking. Top-posting
for once, to make this easy accessible to everyone.

Hey bluetooth-maintainers, what's the status here? I already asked for a
status update more that a week ago and didn't get a reply. Paul also
confirmed recently the issue is still present and no reply either. IOW:
this is talking way to long for a issue that was bisected?

Could you please comment on this? What can be done to get this rolling?
Or do I have to ask upstream maintainers to revert the culprit?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
