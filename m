I don't know enough about SM2.


Which call path are you looking at for "encoding" ?

For IMA's signature verification with public keys we will necessarily 
get into:

public_key_verfiy_signature: 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/crypto/asymmetric_keys/public_key.c#L311

sig->encoding is at least then used in software_key_determine_akcipher: 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/crypto/asymmetric_keys/public_key.c#L66

It doesn't *seem* to be used elsewhere down this call path. Is this not 
enough of looking at 'encoding' that is used to form the alg_name?


Regarding matching of  public_key_signature::pkey_algo and 
public_key::pkey_algo: What could be the implications of this not 
matching? Does it matter? Could one accidentally succeed in verifying a 
signature with the wrong type of key?


As for the proposed patch. I would need to split this up into 3 patches 
with their corresponding fixes tag, either SM2 or ECDRSA in the first 
depending on which one is oldest. But not knowing about SM2 I would 
probably skip this one.

So in the fsverity case that level of indirection is needed, for the 
existing file signatures I don't think we need it.
