I think I must have gone wrong somewhere in that bisection, it took
me through a load of habanalabs commits which were all good, and
blamed the merge which for this which *was* definitely bad, but seems
to have nothing related to the box not powering off on hibernation::

[6f9b5ed8caddfbc94af8307c557ed57a8ec5c65c] Merge tag 'char-misc-5.19-rc1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc

Not Cc'ing Greg at this point, I really don't believe that result.

Starting over.
