Seems like this isn't quite baked yet.  Lorenzo has the v4 of this on
his pci/fu740 branch, but I'm going to drop that for now because (a)
this one is better and (b) it'd be nice to have an ack from a FU740
maintainer (Paul or Greentime).

I'm also not clear on whether this works around a general FU740 defect
or something specific to the Unmatched board or the ASMedia ASM2824
switch.  This patch currently limits to 2.5GT/s on *all* FU740
devices.

I'd prefer to use "2.5GT/s" instead of "Gen1" in the subject, commit
log, and comments because it's more specific and matches the
PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS_2_5GB in the code.

s/capaility/capability/

But the sentence still doesn't quite make sense.  Are you saying that
if we bring the link up at 2.5GT/s, it will stay there?

And that a future reset may clear Link Capabilities?  Actually, I
guess you don't want it *cleared*, you would just want it to
accurately reflect the real max link speed, which would not be 0000b
in the register (since that's not even a defined encoding).

And the reset would also cause link retrain that would then use the
real max link speed?

Wrong comment style (use /* */, not //), and s/unliekly/unlikely/
