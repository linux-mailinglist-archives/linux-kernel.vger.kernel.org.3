The exact mechanism on how the throttling is done is one thing. This can
change. But the fact that _no_ throttling is applied is something that
we shouldn't change of course. If we were really strict we shouldn't
change it even now but considering that the interface is new and
usecases still shaping then better now than later.

IDK, this sounds too much word lawyering to me TBH. It is better to be clear
about explicitly known side effects. For example where do shrinkers
stand in the light of above wording? Kernel can chose to do almost
anything and I do not think we want to control which shrinkers are
triggered and what they do.

So I would really prefer to say something like:
"
Please note that the proactive reclaim (triggered by this interface) is
not meant to indicate memory pressure on the memory cgroup. Therefore
socket memory balancing triggered by the memory reclaim normally is not
exercised in this case. This means that the networking layer will not
adapt based on reclaim induced by memory.reclaim.
