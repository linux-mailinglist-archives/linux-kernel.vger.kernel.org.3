This change should be NOP for psi. psi was already fixed by
e22c6ed90aa9 ("mm: memcontrol: don't count limit-setting reclaim
as memory pressure") by Johannes a while ago. This patch does the same
for vmpressure, but in a different way, as the same approach of
e22c6ed90aa9 cannot be used.

The changes you are seeing in this patch for psi are basically
reverting e22c6ed90aa9 and using the newly introduced flag that
handles vmpressure to handle psi as well, to avoid having two separate
ways to address accounting memory pressure during userspace-induced
reclaim.
