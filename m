Hi Dov,

Yeah, and then dump all the guest memory and thus bypass the whole
memory encryption fun. So yeah, it should be encrypted and accessible
only to the guest and supplied by the guest owner.

Ok, fair enough.

I'd love it if that were more user-friendly:

/sys/kernel/security/secrets/coco/attributes

and there's:

debugging:1
...

and others.

But yeah, that should be the gist of the functionality.

So now that I think of it, it would be even nicer if the fact whether
guest debugging is allowed, were available to the guest *very early*
during boot. Because I think the most important cases where you'd want
to singlestep a SEV* guest with the qemu gdbstub is early guest kernel
boot code. So it would be cool if we'd have access to the debugging
setting that early.

Lemme have a look at your patches in detail to get an idea what's
happening there.

Thx.
