The first case (turn negative) cannot happen because the function is
entered with at least 1 refcount and increments it by 1.
So you can follow commit 46c46f8df9aa ("devpts_pty_kill(): don't bother
with d_delete()") and use d_drop() instead.

As long as we are using debugfs as a reference code, wouldn't
securityfs need to use simple_recursive_removal()?
Can we guaranty that modules always cleanup all entries in
correct order?

d_drop() (see comment above)

Huh? There must be a ref to dentry when entering this function
and there is dget() added above so balance is not lost.
