Yes, there is that too. I think we need a first pass iterating over
the ITSs and invalidate their VPE table pointers, as they may well be
in a shared state. If they are, the ITSs would be liable to generating
RAS errors as well, just like we just saw when sharing the table
between ITS and RDs.

Yeah, please ping me in the new year if you don't hear from me, and
we'll fix that one too.

Indeed.

Thanks,
