 Umm, for all systems I came across except x86, which have native port I/O 
access machine instructions, a port I/O resource records PCI bus addresses 
of the device rather than its CPU addresses, which encode the location of 
an MMIO window the PCI port I/O space is accessed through.  E.g. my RISC-V 
SiFive Unmatched has this:

# cat /proc/ioports
00000000-0000ffff : pcie@e00000000
  00000000-00001fff : PCI Bus 0000:01
    00000000-00001fff : PCI Bus 0000:02
      00000000-00001fff : PCI Bus 0000:05
        00000000-00001fff : PCI Bus 0000:06
          00000000-00000fff : PCI Bus 0000:07

and my MIPS MTI Malta has this:

(though this is not strictly correctly reported, because the legacy junk 
is also behind the GT-64120).  It is especially clear with the Malta that 
PCI port I/O addresses have nothing to do with CPU addresses given this:

# cat /proc/iomem

# 

where we have system RAM from CPU address 0 onwards (of course the Malta 
has legacy PC/ISA junk in the southbridge, so it only allocates native PCI 
port I/O resources from 0x1000 up and therefore it avoids the problem with 
port I/O address 0).

 Maybe there are systems that don't do that and use CPU addresses for port 
I/O resources, but I haven't come across one.

 Sadly it's not recorded in /proc/iomem, but from my understanding of the 
Unmatched DTS the CPU address of PCI I/O port 0 is 0x60080000, and for the 
Malta likewise it's 0x18000000, so the remapping is already there.

 For MMIO I guess this isn't a problem for the systems I know of, but it 
would be if the PCI MMIO access window was decoded at 0 somewhere.  For 
the Unmatched and the Malta the windows are at 0x60090000 and 0x10000000 
respectively.

 A problem with considering an address special, be it 0 or another value, 
is that such a designated location is thrown away.  Buses usually do not 
treat any addresses specially, it's merely a software convention.
