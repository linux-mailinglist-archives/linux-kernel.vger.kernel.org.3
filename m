For now, I have an instrumented kernel that directly invokes arch_stack_walk_reliable()
from various places in the kernel (interrupt handlers, exception handlers, ftrace entry,
kprobe handler, etc). I also have a test driver to induce conditions like null pointer
dereference. I use this to test different cases where arch_stack_walk_reliable() should
return an error.

As for livepatch testing, I have enhanced objtool and the kernel so the frame pointer can
be validated dynamically rather than statically. I have tested various different livepatch
selftests successfully. I have also written my own livepatch tests to add to the selftests.
I am currently working on preparing an RFC patch series for review. Basically, this series
implements STACK_VALIDATION in a different way.

I plan to publish my work soon (hopefully Feb 2022). I was going to do in December. However,
my workload in Microsoft did not permit me to do that. I am also planning to set up a github
repo so people can try out my changes, if they are interested.

So, stay tuned.

Madhavan
