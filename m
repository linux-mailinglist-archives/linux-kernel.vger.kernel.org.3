Thank you, will reword this and re-post.

The note will be removed anyway as explained below.

I wasn't until we finally tracked down and posted the issue about the
gen1 speed setting for bridge probing. All we knew is that the board
would work if you initialised the PCIe in u-boot, and otherwise would
not probe any peripherals. We have posted a patch for that and are
going to try and sort out what needs doing there.

The issue for the probe is here:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-pci&m=164399947722914&w=3

I also think this may never have worked given the issue above, there
are no clear commits that would break this and the driver has had
very little modification since being added. It may have been luck
that most people are booting from a PCIe device and have uboot start
the PCIe for them.

It is possible there may have been changes in the GPIO or GPIO-OF
handling, but again it may have been masked by uboot initialisaton.
Our boot logs suggest somewhere around 5.16 something changed that
stopped probes working. I will try and bisect down next week to see
if the kernel is at fault or some part of the test framework,
uboot changes or other issues.
