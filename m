Hmm, I'd expect that to be part of the attestation dance. I admit,
though, I have only listened about the whole attestation bla from the
sidelines so I'm unclear whether that's part of that protocol. I guess
Tom and Brijesh should have a better idea here.

Well, is that "one way" or *the way*?

Because we would need *some* way of verifying the owner is talking
to the correct guest. And if so, this should be made part of the big
picture of SEV guest attestation. Or is this part of that attestation
dance?

I guess I'm wondering where in the big picture this fits into?

So one of the aspects for this is to use it in automated deployments.

Right, and is this going to be the proper way to authenticate SEV guests
to their owners or is this just another technique for safely supplying
secrets into the guest?

I hope I'm making some sense here...
