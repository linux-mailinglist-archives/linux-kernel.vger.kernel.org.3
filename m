According to my understanding, No as there will be no no_memcg. All
children groups under root would have its cgroup.controllers = memory
as long as root has memory enabled. Under this circumstance, all
descendants group under 'no_memcg' will charge memory to its parent
group. This is caused by e_css  policy when apply subsys control which
have child group use its first level ancestors css.
