Managing the MOK keys requires physical presence equally.

Moreover, these keys are trusted for running code at ring0, in fact the
running kernel is expected to be signed by one of them, and can be
signed by any of them.

Then what exact purpose does this extra flag serve?

If such compile-time flag exists in the kernel it cannot be overriden by
the root once the kernel is signed, either.

That's answer to a completely different question, though.

You either import the keys and use them, or you don't use them and don't
import them. The option to import and not use is not available.

Like not using that extra flag at all?

Thanks
