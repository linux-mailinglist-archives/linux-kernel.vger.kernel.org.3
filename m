The thing is, I don't need it, while you apparently do need a change
in the kernel.

Yes. And it covers all the systems we care about so far. It is small,
fixed in size, and doesn't impose extra requirements on everyone else.
Your system changes the requirement, and it is the opportunity to
revisit an 11 year old decision.

No, it is about who has the need. You do, and nobody else does.

It is pretty wrong when it adds unneeded overhead on systems that
don't require this, and doesn't scale in the face of existing
architectures (let alone future ones). Distributions ship a single
kernel image, and would obviously select the largest possible value,
just to maximise perceived compatibility requirements. My ask is that
you don't inflict this on systems that do not need it.

Well, I'm another "someone on the list" asking you to do better. You
are perfectly entitled to ignore me, and I'm just as entitled to voice
my opposition to your approach.
