Well, superblock is stored at s_first_data_block offset. So strictly
speaking the check should be < s_first_data_block because that block is a
valid filesystem block. OTOH in most places you are not supposed to look at
block with the superblock so stricter <= s_first_data_block is fine.

That's what we discussed on our ext4 call yesterday. Normally,
s_first_data_block is 1 for blocksize 1k and 0 for blocksize > 1k. So for
1k blocksize the first group begins with block 1 and not block 0.
Effectively the whole filesystem is shifted by 1 block with 1k blocksize.
When bigalloc comes to play and blocksize is 1k, things are even more
interesting because there, the first group starts at block 0 while
s_first_data_block is still 1, because superblock is stored in block 1 of
cluster 0.
