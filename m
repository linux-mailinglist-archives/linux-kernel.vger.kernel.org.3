Ah, right, thanks Christian.

But so the code - I think where the ima_ns is defined in the user_ns
struct, needs to make this clear.  Just something like

	// Pointer to ima_ns which this user_ns created.  Can be null.
	// Access checks will walk the userns->parent chain and check
	// against all active ima_ns's.  Note that when the user_ns is
	// freed, the ima_ns is guaranteed to be free-able.
	struct ima_namespace	*ima_ns;
