It's about knowing whether or not firmware has declared the ports at 
all. If it hasn't then the system is vulnerable to *some* degree of DMA 
attacks regardless of anything else (the exact degree depending on 
kernel config and user overrides). Complete mitigation is simply too 
expensive to apply by default to every device the IOMMU layer is unsure 
about. The Thunderbolt driver cannot be confident that protection is in 
place unless it can somehow know that the IOMMU layer has seen that 
untrusted property on the relevant ports.

Indeed that's exactly what I want to do, but it begs the question of how 
we *find* the firmware-provided information in the first place!

I seem to have already started writing the dumb version that will walk 
the whole PCI segment and assume the presence of any external-facing 
port implies that we're good. Let me know if I should stop ;)

Cheers,
Robin.
