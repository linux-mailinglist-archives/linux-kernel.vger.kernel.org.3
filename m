Why "can be"?  TDX must use QE to generate the Quote.

Right the TDREPORT itself isn't a secret.  However my thinking is the REPORTDATA
might be.  It's typically provided by the attestation service to the TD so the
Quote can be verified for instance per-session or per-connect or whatever.  The
REPORTDATA is the only thing that can be used to prevent reply attack anyway. 
From this perspective, it is kinda secret.  However the TDREPORT can be captured
by untrusted software and used for reply attack if no crypto-protection is used
when it is sent to the QE, so I am not sure how bad can the reply attack cause.

Let's forget about GetQuote now.  As you can see it has couple of problems.  

If we don't argue from security perspective, what's wrong with the approach
using /sysfs I mentioned above?

No problem.

Bits 0:31 are also defined by TDX error codes.  For instance, it also prints
which argument caused this error in case of OPERAND_INVALID.  Why is it not
useful?

I don't quite get.  Why "userspace will print the error or not" has anything to
do with using pr_debug() vs pr_err() here?

Which TDCALL?

And TDCALL is kernel internal implementation, but we are talking about userspace
ABI here.  I don't see any connection between them.

My thinking is you don't need to call out the exact TDCALL in the uapi header. 
But no opinion here.  Will leave to maintainers.
