Are you saying that this DT ranges and the dmesg line are connected?

  ranges = <0x82000000 0 0 0x82000000 0x1 0 1 0
            0x81000000 0 0 0x81000000 0x1 0 1 0>;

  mvebu-pcie soc:pcie: MEM 0xffffffffffffffff..0x00fffffffe -> 0x0100000000

1) It would be nice if there were a hint somewhere in Documentation/
that would allow mere mortals to see the connection there.

2) Why do we have these DT entries if they are invalid and useless?

So mvebu-mbus.c fills in the static mbus_state from the DT
"pcie-mem-aperture", which seems unconnected to the DT descriptions of
the PCI controllers:

  static struct mvebu_mbus_state mbus_state;

  mvebu_mbus_dt_init
    mvebu_mbus_get_pcie_resources(&mbus_state.pcie_mem_aperture)
      of_property_read_u32_array("pcie-mem-aperture")

  mvebu_pcie_probe
    mvebu_pcie_parse_request_resources
      mvebu_mbus_get_pcie_mem_aperture(&pcie->mem)
	*res = mbus_state.pcie_mem_aperture
      pci_add_resource(&bridge->windows, &pcie->mem)

I see 0xf1080000-0xf1081fff, 0xf1040000-0xf1041fff, etc mentioned in
the DT info above, but I don't see where [mem 0xe0000000-0xe7ffffff]
came from.

Regardless, this means PCI thinks [mem 0xe0000000-0xe7ffffff] is
available on bus 00 and can be assigned to devices on bus 00 according
to the normal PCI rules (BARs aligned on size, PCI bridge windows
aligned on 1MB and multiple of 1MB in size).  IIUC, mvebu imposes
additional alignment constraints on the bridge windows.

These are the bridge window assignments from your dmesg:

The PCI core knows nothing about the mvebu constraints.  Are we just
lucky here that when PCI assigned these bridge windows, they happen to
be supported on mvebu?  What happens if PCI decides it needs 29MB on
bus 01?

So IIUC,

  pcie1 == 00:01.0 Root Port
  pcie2 == 00:02.0 Root Port
  pcie3 == 00:03.0 Root Port

From a software point of view, they're all under a single host bridge,
and Linux assumes everything under a host bridge plays by the PCI
rules.

In this case, the root ports *don't* play by the rules since they have
additional alignment restrictions, so I think these really should be
described as separate host bridges in DT with the address space
carved up statically among them.

It's common on x86 to have multiple host bridges that all appear to
software to be in domain 0000.  The bus number ranges under each are
static, e.g., one bridge has [bus 00-7f] and another has [bus 80-ff].

It could be described as a separate host bridge for every root port.
ACPI uses _CRS (current resource settings) to describe the apertures
to PCI and any address translation.  Currently the _CRS description is
static, but ACPI does allow those resource assignments to be modified
via _PRS (possible resource settings) and _SRS (set resource
settings).
