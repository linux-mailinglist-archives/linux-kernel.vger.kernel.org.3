It would help to share warning outputs (or whatever) from DEBUG_KOBJECTS.

I think that this might be, once again, a false positive. We use kobjects 
differently than what the kobject implementation and its documentation 
assume. So not doing anything after kobject_init() and kobject_add() in 
_init_early stages could be perfectly fine. DEBUG_KOBJECTS output would be 
really welcome.

And if it is not a false positive, we should implement some rollback for 
processed klp_funcs and klp_objects if an error happens. It is not only 
klp_patch kobject affected.
