Sure, whatever. I mean, if you think it's preferable to have 3 API
abstractions for the same concept each for it's special usecase, then
that's certainly one way to do things. I personally would try to
figure out a modicum of generalization for things like this. But maybe
that' just meâ€¦

I can just tell you, that in systemd we'd have a usecase for consuming
such a generation counter: we try to provide stable MAC addresses for
synthetic network interfaces managed by networkd, so we hash them from
/etc/machine-id, but otoh people also want them to change when they
clone their VMs. We could very nicely solve this if we had a
generation counter easily accessible from userspace, that starts at 0
initially. Because then we can hash as we always did when the counter
is zero, but otherwise use something else, possibly hashed from the
generation counter.

But anyway, I understand you are not interested in
generalization/other usecases, so I'll shut up.
