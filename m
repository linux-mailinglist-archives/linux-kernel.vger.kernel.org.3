Hi Bjorn,

This is incorrect.  The regression occurred because the code mistakenly
skips PCIe-linkup if the PCI portdrv DT node  does not exist. With our
RC HW, doing a config space access to bus 1  w/o first linking up results
in a  CPU abort.  This regression has nothing to do with EP power at all.

The RPi does not use the "PCIe regulator" feature of my original patchset.
It is currently used only by our STB and Cable Modem  products.

Are you referring to my original patchset or the one I just submitted?
 If the former,
yes.  If the latter, no.

They are turned off to conserve power.

For STB and Cable Modem products we do not leave the power on.  In
fact, our Cable
Modem group was the first to request this feature.   It appears that the RPi CM4
always keeps endpoint power on but I do not know for sure.

AFAICT, Broadcom STB and Cable Modem products do not have/use/want ACPI.
We are fine with keeping this "PCIe regulator" feature private to our driver and
giving you speedy and full support in maintaining it.

Yes  -- it is the "chicken-and-egg" problem.  Ideally, we would like
for the endpoint
driver to turn on its own regulators, but even to know which endpoint
driver to probe
we must turn on the regulator to establish linkup.

Correct.

I agree.  That is why I said that we should consider removing the "busno==1"
conditional if we want this feature for general use.  If you want,
I can submit a V2 that removes this conditional.

I'm guessing here but I think the Rockchip folks could use this "pcie
regulator"  feature.
They got regulator DT properties in their PCIe RC DT node upstreamed
but we were denied for trying the same approach.

I have a series of patches coming up that address some of these concerns.
Can we please take this up then but allow us to escape "revert jail" first?
I promise I will copy your tangents and address all of them with the
future patchset.

I will fix this in the future patchset.

I will improve the situation in the future patchset
