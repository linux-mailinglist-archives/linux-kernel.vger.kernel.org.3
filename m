Eric, did you say you're working on fixes to address these problems?

Instead of using a flexible array, Vitaly suggested defining the hash
as FS_VERITY_MAX_DIGEST_SIZE, so that it could be allocated temporarily
on stack
instead of kalloc.

As the above struct is not limited to fsverity, we could use
MAX_HASH_DIGESTSIZE, if it was exported, but it isn't.  Would the
following work for you?

/*
 * IMA signature header version 3 disambiguates the data that is signed
by
 * indirectly signing the hash of this structure, containing either the
 * fsverity_descriptor struct digest or, in the future, the traditional
IMA
 * file hash.
 */
struct ima_file_id {
        __u8 is_fsverity;       /* set to 1 for IMA_VERITY_DIGSIG */
        __u8 hash_algorithm;    /* Digest algorithm [enum hash_algo] */
#ifdef __KERNEL__
        __u8 hash[HASH_MAX_DIGESTSIZE];
#else
        __u8 hash[];
#endif
};

thanks,

Mimi
