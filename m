Avoiding phy powerdown in host mode when dwc3 is wakeup capable, so that
it can be wake up by devices. Keep usb30_prim gdsc active to retain
controller status during suspend/resume.

Changes in v20:
Fixed nitpicks in dwc3 qcom driver.
Fixed code changes in dwc3 core driver.

Changes in v19:
Fixed dwc3 driver code changes.

Changes in v18:
Fixed minor nit picks in v17 reported by Matthias.

Changes in v17:
Moved the speed check to glue driver.
Powering down phy's solely based on dwc3 wakeup capability.
Configuring the interrupt functions appropriately.

Changes in v16:
Added changes to power down the phy's during suspend only if dwc3
is not wakeup capable.

Changes in v15:
Added patch to enable wakeup for xhci-plat based on children wakeup status.
Used device_wakeup_path instead of device_children_wakeup_capable

Changes in v14:
Added patch for device_children_wakeup_capable.
Used device_children_wakeup_capable instead of usb_wakeup_enabled_descendants.
Fixed minor nit picks in v13 reported by Matthias.

Changes in v13:
Moved the dt bindings patch to start.
Changed dwc3_set_phy_speed_mode to dwc3_check_phy_speed_mode.
Check wakep-source property for dwc3 core node to set the
wakeup capability. Drop the device_init_wakeup call from
runtime suspend and resume.
Added GENPD_FLAG_RPM_ALWAYS_ON and set GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON if
wakeup is supported.

Changes in v12:
Squashed PATCH 1/5 and 2/5 of v11.
Added dt bindings and device tree entry for wakeup-source property
for dwc3 core node.
Dropped redundant phy_set_mode call.


Changes in v11:
Moving back to v8 version
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-arm-msm/cover/1624882097-23265-1-git-send-email-sanm@codeaurora.org
as we are getting interrupts during suspend
when enabling both DP hs phy irq and DM hs phy irq.
Moved the set phy mode function to dwc3/core.c from xhci-plat.c
We didn't find any other option other than accessing xhci from dwc.

Changes in v10:
PATCH 1/6: Change device_set_wakeup_capable to device_set_wakeup_enable
PATCH 2/6: Remove redundant else part in dwc3_resume_common
PATCH 4/6: Change the irg flags
PATCH 5/6: Set flag GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON
PATCH 6/6: Remove disable interrupts function and enable
interrupts in probe.


Changes in v9:
Checking with device_may_makeup property instead of phy_power_off flag.
Changed the IRQ flags and removed hs_phy_mode variable.

Changes in v8:
Moved the dwc3 suspend quirk code in dwc3/host.c to xhci-plat.c
Checking phy_power_off flag instead of usb_wakeup_enabled_descendants 
to keep gdsc active.

Changes in v7:
Change in commit text and message in PATCH 1/5 and PATCH 5/5
as per Matthias suggestion.
Added curly braces for if and else if sections in PATCH 4/5.

Changes in v6:
Addressed comments in host.c and core.c
Separated the patches in dwc3-qcom.c to make it simple.
Dropped wakeup-source change as it is not related to this series.

Changes in v5:
Added phy_power_off flag to check presence of wakeup capable devices.
Dropped patch[v4,4/5] as it is present linux-next.
Addressed comments in host.c and dwc3-qcom.c.

Changes in v4:
Addressed Matthias comments raised in v3.

Changes in v3:
Removed need_phy_for_wakeup flag and by default avoiding phy powerdown.
Addressed Matthias comments and added entry for DEV_SUPERSPEED.
Added suspend_quirk in dwc3 host and moved the dwc3_set_phy_speed_flags.
Added wakeup-source dt entry and reading in dwc-qcom.c glue driver.

Changes in v2:
Dropped the patch in clock to set GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP flag and 
setting in usb dwc3 driver.
Separated the core patch and glue driver patch.
Made need_phy_for_wakeup flag part of dwc structure and 
hs_phy_flags as unsgined int.
Adrressed the comment on device_init_wakeup call.
Corrected offset for reading portsc register.
Added pacth to support wakeup in xo shutdown case.
