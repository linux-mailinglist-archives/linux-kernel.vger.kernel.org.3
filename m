Good point. Well, even these file do not point to the documentation
generated from the sources.

Good question. I am not expert on writing documentation and I can't
find any good example of API documentation at
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/index.html

One reason might be that most of the documentation was written as plain text
in the past. And many people still read it in the original .rst form.

Another problem is that livepatch documentation is a mix of several
independent pieces written by different authors. It would deserve
a lot of work:

    + Connect the pieces
    + Add missing information
    + Make the style and structure consistent


Anyway, I think that the documentation generated from the sources
is useful. But it is hard to integrate it into .rst file that should
be useful even in the .rst format.

From this POV, I suggest to create Documentation/livepatch/API.rst
and add there the documentation generated from the sources. I mean
something like:

    Documentation/core-api/kernel-api.rst

that results into

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/kernel-api.html


The livepatch/API.rst might include documentation from

    include/linux/livepatch.h
    kernel/livepatch/code.c
    kernel/livepatch/shadow.c
    kernel/livepatch/state.c


But let's wait if there are other opinions from another livepatch
developers.

Best Regards,
Petr
