Though without doubt, your solution is doable, I have a 
discussion with the Intel architect and they insisted that
the device driver must not make such a decision. The decision to 
drop or accept a transfer is up to the firmware. The firmware
insisted that the buffer be padded with whatever value. They
desire the transfer protocol to be obeyed to ensure, that 
there is no hard dependencies on the device driver if they
do one day change the 4kbytes to some other smaller value.

Same reasoning as above. We don't want the driver to make this
decision.

Yes, it could look confusing to other programmers. And, yes, the 
padding doesn't matter. Let me relook into this. As the driver is 
already re-tested by the silicon validatioin. 
I want to avoid making any change as it
would meant another couple of weeks of re-testing. 
Can this be accepted as it is?
