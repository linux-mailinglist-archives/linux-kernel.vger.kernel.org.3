We do know about a workload that originally inspired this investigation of
feasibility, but it's proprietary and will take a while to evaluate the
benefits there. We did hope that a public RFC could lead to discovering
others that also have a workload that would benefit, and might currently use
some userspace workarounds due to the existing limitations.

True, it was one of the goals, to see how complex exactly it would be. And
an opportunity to better document related parts of mm as part of the master
thesis :)

Stats so far have shown that merges that this enables did happen, only a few
percent cases didn't. Of course for many workloads the extra merges will not
bring much benefit. One possibility is to introduce an opt-in mode (prctl or
madvise?) for workloads that know they would benefit.

> I donno, the effort looks dubious to me as of now.
 At least patches 1+2 could be considered immediately, as they don't bring
extra complexity.

A related issue which was brought to our attention is that current mremap()
implementation doesn't work on a range that spans multiple vma's. The
multiple vma's may be result of the current insufficient merging, or
otherwise. And it's tedious for userspace to discover the boundaries from
/proc/pid/maps to guide a mremap() vma by vma. More sucessful merging would
thus help, but it should be also possible to improve the mremap()
implementation, which shouldn't be as complex...
