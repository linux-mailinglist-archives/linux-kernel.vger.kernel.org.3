Ah, I suppose because the regulators are not under the host bridge
itself, but under the *root port*, which is a PCI device that doesn't
exist until we enumerate it.  Although I guess the root port is
described in the DT, and the regulators are connected with that DT
description, not directly with the pci_dev.

Makes sense.

Yep, sounds like the right thing.
