Ideally all glue drivers would add component support, however I don't think
it is strictly necessary. Currently the dwc3 core already assumes that
everything is in place when it is probed. The core could have empty bind()
and unbind() callbacks, with that things in the core would remain
essentially as they are and the core doesn't depend on the glue driver to
call component_bind_all().

As mentioned above, it shouldn't be necessary to add component support to
all the glue drivers. An API to check for deferred probing is an option,
however there is a possible race condition: When the dwc3-qcom driver checks
for a deferred probe the core could still be probing, in that situation the
glue would proceed before the core driver is ready. That could be avoided
with the component based approach.
