Using the async API seems much more reasonable than adding new callbacks.

However I'd argue that it shouldn't be necessary to amend any drivers,
this should all be doable in the driver core:  Basically a device needs
to wait for its children and device links consumers to shutdown, apart
from that everything should be able to run asynchronously.

Thanks,
