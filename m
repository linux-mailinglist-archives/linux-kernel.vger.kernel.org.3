It is because this change is incompatible with deprecated pci-OF-bus-map
which pmac uses. I do not have any pmac box for testing or development,
so I let this part as is.

If one day pci-OF-bus-map would be possible to disable on pmac then this
pci bus number change can be enabled also for pmac.

I have tested it on P2020 board with 3 PCIe devices, each on own bus
where each bus is connected to different PCIe controller / domain and it
works correctly. Every PCIe device is on bus 1 bus but on different
domains.
