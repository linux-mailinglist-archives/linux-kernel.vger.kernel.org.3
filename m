Not really.  The SD card controller is a "standard" GL9755 PCIe SDHC
controller that is already supported by Linux.

It does indeed get a DT node though because the card detect and write
protect signals are inverted and the driver needs to initialize some
PCIe config space registers to compensate for that.

That isn't obvious.  Even though there isn't an actual PCIe slot these
still are PCIe compliant devices and therefore governed by the PCIe
standard power up sequencing.

I don't think there is a fundamental difference between having a GPIO
that controls the standard voltage rails of a PCIe slot (like on the
HiFive Unmatched board) and a GPIO that controls the power to a chip
soldered onto the motherboard (like the ASM2824 soldered onto the
HiFive Unmatched board and WiFi/SD on these Apple M1 systems).  I
don't think it makes sense to describe this in different ways just
because in one case there is a physical connector present.

Note that the proposed patch does add the "pwren-gpio" property on the
root port node as you suggest.

But in the case of an actual PCIe slot firmware can't really describe
the PCIe device itself in the DT since it might not be there.

And your suggestion would be quite painful in other contexts where the
device tree will be used (U-Boot, *BSD), which all assume that a PCI
bus can be enumerated.
