Thanks for the analysis and the fix! As you noted above this is actually a
bug in the filesystems that they assume that locked buffer means it is
under IO.  Usually that is the case but there are other places that lock
the buffer without doing IO. Page migration is one of them, jbd2 machinery
another one, there may be others.

So I think this really ought to be fixed in filesystems instead of papering
over the bug in the migration code. I agree this is more work but we will
reduce the technical debt, not increase it :). Honestly, ll_rw_block()
should just die. It is actively dangerous to use. Instead we should have
one call for readahead of bhs and the rest should be converted to
submit_bh() or similar calls. There are like 25 callers remaining so it
won't be even that hard.

And then we have the same buggy code as in ll_rw_block() copied to
ext4_bread_batch() (ext4_read_bh_lock() in particular) so that needs to be
fixed as well...
