I generally agree with the sentiment, however UEFI variables should IMHO be
handled by the kernel. Moving handling of those to userspace breaks things like
EFI-based pstore and efivarfs. The latter will in turn break some user-space
tools (most notably efibootmgr used by e.g. GRUB and I think fwupdmgr which
needs to set some capsule variables). Ideally, we would find a way to not break
these, i.e. have them work out-of-the-box.

A similar argumentation might apply to the TPM app.

Thanks for this information! So as far as I understand it, this is currently an
interface to user-space only, i.e. does not allow in-kernel drivers for apps?
It would be great if this could then be extended to handle (the bare minimum
of) in-kernel drivers (i.e. only things that the kernel itself needs, like EFI
variables). Alternatively, I'm happy to hear suggestions on how we not break
the aforementioned things while moving handling off to userspace.

I think that would be great! Thanks!
