I'm not sure it will be possible to programatically detect why the
ABBA deadlock isn't possible without having the static analyzer having
a semantic understanding how the code works (so it can understand that
that code path which leads to the ABBA deadlock won't get executed).

It may very well be that being able to understand why the ABBA
deadlock can't happen in that case is equivalent to solving the
halting problem.  But if you do come up with a clever way of improving
your static analysis tool, I'll be excited to see it!
