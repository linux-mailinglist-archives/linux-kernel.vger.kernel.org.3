Valid points. I understood Serge as suggesting an implementation detail
change not a design change but might misunderstand him here.

# Currently

1. create new userns -> imans set to NULL
2. mount securityfs and configure imans -> set imans to &new_ima_ns

When 2. hasn't been done then we find the relevant imans by walking
the userns hierarchy upwards finding the first parent userns that has a
non-NULL imans.

# Serge's suggestion

1. create new userns -> imans is set to parent imans
2. mount securityfs and configure imans -> replace parent with &new_ima_ns

So when 2. hasn't been done we don't need to walk the userns hierarchy
upwards. We always find the relevant imans directly. Some massaging
would be needed in process_measurement() probably but it wouldn't need
to change semantics per se.

But I think I misunderstood something in any case. So looking at an
example like ima_post_path_mknod(). You seem to not call into
ima_must_appraise() if the caller's userns doesn't have an imans
enabled. I somehow had thought that the same logic applied as in
process_measurement. But if it isn't then it might make sense to keep
the current implementation.
