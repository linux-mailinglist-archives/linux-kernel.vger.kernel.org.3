I have been looking at the code and the patchset and I think there
might be a problem with the stats, at least for cgroup v1. Lets say we
have a parent memcg P, which has a child memcg C. When processes in
memcg C allocate memory the stats (e.g. NR_ANON_MAPPED) are updated
for C (non-hierarchical per-cpu counters, memcg->vmstats_percpu), and
for P (aggregated stats, memcg->vmstats).

When memcg C is offlined, its pages are reparented to memcg P, so far
P->vmstats (hierarchical) still have those pages, and
P->vmstats_percpu (non-hierarchical) don't. So far so good.

Now those reparented pages get uncharged, but their memcg is P now, so
they get subtracted from P's *non-hierarchical* stats (and eventually
hierarchical stats as well). So now P->vmstats (hierarchical)
decreases, which is correct, but P->vmstats_percpu (non-hierarchical)
also decreases, which is wrong, as those stats were never added to
P->vmstats_percpu to begin with.

From a cgroup v2 perspective *maybe* everything continues to work, but
this breaks cgroup v1 non-hierarchical stats. In fact, if the
reparented memory exceeds the original non-hierarchical memory in P,
we can underflow those stats  because we are subtracting stats that
were never added in the first place.

Please let me know if I am misunderstanding something and there is
actually no problem with the non-hierarchical stats (you can stop
reading here if this is all in my head and there's actually no
problem).

Off the top of my mind we can handle stats modifications of reparented
memory separately. We should not updated local per-cpu counters, maybe
we should rather update memcg->vmstat.state_pending directly so that
the changes appear as if they come from a child memcg. Two problems
come with such an approach:

1) memcg->vmstat.state_pending is shared between cpus, and so far is
only modified by mem_cgroup_css_rstat_flush() in locked context. A
solution would be to add reparented state to
memcg->vmstat.state_percpu instead and treat it like
memcg->vmstat.state_pending in mem_cgroup_css_rstat_flush(). Keep in
mind that this adds a tiny bit of memory overhead (roughly 8
bytes*num_cpus for each memcg).

2) Identifying that we are updating stats of reparented memory. This
should be easy if we have a pointer to the page to compare page->objcg
with page->objcg->memcg->objcg, but AFAICT the memcg stats are updated
in __mod_memcg_state() and __mod_memcg_lruvec_state(), and we have no
idea in each of these what page(s) is the stats update associated
with. They are called from many different places, it would be
troublesome to pass such information down from all call sites. I have
nothing off the top of my head to fix this problem except passing the
necessary info through all code paths to __mod_memcg_state() and
__mod_memcg_lruvec_state(), which is far from ideal.

Again, I am sorry if these discussions are late, I didn't have time to
look at previous versions of this patchset.
