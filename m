I agree that depending on the initial power state is confusing (it
confused me :)).

What would you think of replacing this patch with the one below?


commit defde70748bc ("PCI/PM: Always put device in D0 and disable PME in pci_power_up()")
Author: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com>
Date:   Fri May 27 17:45:07 2022 -0500

    PCI/PM: Always put device in D0 and disable PME in pci_power_up()
    
    Unconditionally put the device in PCI_D0 and disable PME generation in
    pci_power_up(), regardless of the power state returned by the previous read
    from PCI_PM_CTRL, which should not matter.
