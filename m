There are two things here:

1) As Rob mentioned, you can write it as a quirk applying only to the
   bridge _only_
2) What you want is that the BAR should not be visible to the OS since
   it is not an actual resource. What I am questioning is whether your
   way of doing that complies with how this is done in the kernel for
   other devices/bridges. I need Bjorn's input on this since he knows
   better (especially wrt IORESOURCE_UNSET usage). I don't want to add
   any other IORESOURCE_UNSET usage that deviates from what's expected
   from it
