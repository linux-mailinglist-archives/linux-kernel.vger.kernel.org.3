I can't follow you here. My SDIO wireless card just works in an SD
slot and doesn't have to be described.

Where is the assumption when the DT tells you there is a flash
on a specific chip select but actually there it isn't. Shouldn't
the DT then be fixed?

Maybe I don't understand your problem. What are you trying to
solve? I mean this just demotes an error to an info message.

Or let the bootloader update your device tree and disable the device
if it's not there? Or load an overlay if it is there?
