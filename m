Sorry for any misunderstanding among the discussion. My purpose is
real and simple as I have stated from the very beginning that I would
like to have per-app cgroup hierarchy to charge memory to root if it
is not enabled explicitly for memory. The reason has also been stated
like reclaim and workingset regression in suren's report. I don't
think my proposal will do any harm to current v2's mechanism besides
asking for the admin echo "+memory" to their desire group.
