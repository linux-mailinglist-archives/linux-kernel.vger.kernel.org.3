I would love to have somebody work on this because every native driver
does it differently and I'm guessing none of them really do it
correctly.

Note that struct pci_host_bridge is a 1:many situation with Root
Ports, which is where the link management is.  Unfortunately many
drivers have the single Root Port assumption baked into them.

I think I would start small, by adding some #defines for T_PVPERL,
T_PERSTCLK, etc, and using them, which will probably expose lots of
gaps and hidden assumptions.  Then maybe add the callback functions
but use them internally to the driver before moving the calls to the
shared core.  I like it best when reorganizations like moving all the
initialization steps into the core are simple "code move only, no
functional change" sort of things.
