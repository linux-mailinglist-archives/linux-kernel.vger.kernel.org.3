Update to v21, the metrics are based on TMA 4.4 full.

Use script at:
https://github.com/intel/event-converter-for-linux-perf/blob/master/downloa=
d_and_gen.py

to download and generate the latest events and metrics. Manually copy
the ivytown files into perf and update mapfile.csv.

Tested on a non-ivytown with 'perf test':
 10: PMU events                                                      :
 10.1: PMU event table sanity                                        : Ok
 10.2: PMU event map aliases                                         : Ok
 10.3: Parsing of PMU event table metrics                            : Ok
 10.4: Parsing of PMU event table metrics with fake PMUs             : Ok

(L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many=
 fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI speed (for example, 8.0=
 GT/s), the transfers here refer to fits.  Therefore, in L0, the system wil=
l transfer 1 flit at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate th=
e bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not t=
he same as data bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cach=
eline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header informatio=
n and 8 with 64 bits of actual data and an additional 16 bits of other info=
