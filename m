Yes, there are PCI specific ways to handle some of this when it is 
signals or power for standard PCI slots. But then it's also possible 
that you have a soldered down device that has extra or different 
interfaces.

When this Broadcom thread was reviewed originally, I was the one pushing 
this towards doing this in the portdrv. That seems like the more 
logical place at least to control the root port state even if we need 
host controller specific routines to do the work. It's all related to 
how do we separate out host bridge and root port operations.

Yeah, I think that's a different issue.

Shrug. Honestly, the PCI specific power management stuff is not 
something I've studied. I'm a bit more fluent runtime PM.

Somewhat related to all this is this thread[4] where I've suggested that 
the right way to save power when there's no link (or child device 
really) is using runtime PM rather than just failing probe. We also 
don't need each host controller doing their own conformance test hacks 
either.

Yes! A NIC as an add-in card doesn't need anything because it's just a 
standard PCI connector with standard power sequencing. But take that 
same NIC chip and solder it down on a board. Then the board designers 
start cost saving and remove components. For example, there's no need 
for standard PCI supply to chip supply regulators (e.g. 12V/3.3V to 
whatever the chip has). Who needs an EEPROM with a MAC address either.

I think there's roughly 2 cases we're dealing with. The platform 
specific ways to do power control on standard PCIe slots/connectors, and 
then non-standard connections that need downstream device specific ways 
to do power management (including powering on to be discovered). The 
line is blurred a bit because the latter case needs some of the former 
case (at least any in-band PCI power management). The problem I see all 
the time (not just PCI) is people trying to implement something 
generic/common rather than device specific which then makes its way into 
bindings. The only way something generic works is if there's a spec 
behind it. For PCI slots there is, but it is important we distinguish 
the 2 cases.
