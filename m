I'm not quite sure what you mean by "we measure the kexec pieces".  The
kexec file load syscall calls kernel_read_file_from_fd() to read the
kernel image into a buffer.  The measurement record included in the IMA
measurement list a hash of the buffer data, which is exactly the same
as the hash of the kernel image.

The kernel kexec self tests only do the kexec load, not the execute. 
For each kexec execute you'll see an additional "boot_aggregate" record
in the IMA measurement list.  At least for the moment I don't see a
need for additional marker.

thanks,

Mimi
