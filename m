Hey Muchun,

Quick question regarding the behavior of this change on cgroup v1 (I
know .. I know .. sorry):

When a memcg dies, its LRU pages are reparented, but what happens to
the charge? IIUC we don't do anything because the pages are already
hierarchically charged to the parent. Is this correct?

In cgroup v1, we have non-hierarchical stats as well, so I am trying
to understand if the reparented memory will appear in the
non-hierarchical stats of the parent (my understanding is that the
will not). I am also particularly interested in the charging behavior
of pages that get reparented to root_mem_cgroup.

The main reason I am asking is that (hierarchical_usage -
non-hierarchical_usage - children_hierarchical_usage) is *roughly*
something that we use, especially at the root level, to estimate
zombie memory usage. I am trying to see if this change will break such
calculations. Thanks!
