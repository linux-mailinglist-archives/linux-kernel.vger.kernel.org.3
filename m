Oh, don't think I *like* having quirks in the driver, it just seems like 
the least-worst choice from a bad bunch. All of the default domain 
quirks so far (including this one) exist for integrated devices and/or 
dodgy firmware setups such that they are platform-specific, so there is 
no technical reason for trying to split *some* of them off into a 
generic mechanism when the driver-based platform-specific mechanism 
still needs to exist anyway (some of them do depend on driver state as 
well).

Feel free to test the waters with a patch punting 
qcom_smmu_def_domain_type() to core code, but I think you'll struggle to 
find a reason to give in the commit message other than "I don't like it".

See intel-iommu's device_def_domain_type() implementation. The shape of 
it may seem quite familiar...
