I cannot really give you configuration you want without understanding
what you are trying to achieve and why do you need it that way. Really,
you can construct arbitrary hierarchies and only a very small subset of
them actually makes sense. So far you have been very terse at your goals
and intentions but rather demanding on the underlying mechanisms. This
doesn't really makes the discussion productive.

I hope you have at least understood that hierarchical property of the
cgroup v2 is a must and it won't change. If you need a help to construct
hierarchy for your specific workload I would recommend to clearly state
your final goal and reasoning behind. Maybe you will get a more specific
help that way. Good luck!
