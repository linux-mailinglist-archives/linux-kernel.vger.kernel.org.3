My point is that for regular swap backends there is already
PSWP*. Distinguishing traffic between two swap backends is legitimate
of course, but zram is not really special compared to other backends
from that POV. It's only special in its memory consumption.

zswap *is* special, though. Even though some people use it *like* a
swap backend, it's also a cache on top of swap. zswap loads and stores
do not show up in PSWP*. And they shouldn't, because in a cache
configuration, you still need the separate PSWP* stats to understand
cache eviction behavior and cache miss ratio. memory -> zswap is
ZSWPOUT; zswap -> disk is PSWPOUT; PSWPIN is a cache miss etc.

Right. zram and zswap overlap in their functionality and have similar
deficits in their stats. Both should be fixed, I'm not opposing
that. But IMO we should be careful about conflating
them. Fundamentally, one is a block device, the other is an MM-native
cache layer that sits on top of block devices. Drawing false
equivalencies between them will come back to haunt us.
