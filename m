Yikes, I meant to refer Documentation/power/suspend-and-interrupts.rst

Correct.

One possible solution IIUC the issue is to add this as additional CPU Idle
state disabled most of the time. Enable them from user-space just prior to
calling freeze/s2idle, so that PSCI CPU_SUSPEND is called with right param
to indicate this is deepest idle state(in your case just WFI) + DRAM self
refresh/retention mode. Also TF-A can take care to enable the side band
interrupts before entering the state.

Do you see any issue with this approach ? I am trying to find ways to avoid
deviating from standard PSCI.

Understood and I do remember that.
