yes

Problem is that "ranges" in PCIe are used for specifying MEM and IO
mappings and kernel PCI code does not allow any other type.

It is more complicated. PCIe MEM and IO memory ranges are defined in
"soc" node in "pcie-mem-aperture" and "pcie-io-aperture" properties.
These ranges are shared across all PCIe controllers and assigning slices
of these ranges to specific devices is done later by dynamic allocation.
"soc" node is bind to mbus driver (which parse these properties) and
provides API for other kernel drivers for dynamic allocation of memory
from pcie aperture. In pcie node is just indirect reference to PCIe MEM
and IO via MBUS_ID() macro and it is pci-mvebu.c driver who ask mbus
driver for PCIe MEM and IO dynamic allocation.

So because PCIe config space is not of type PCIe MEM nor PCIe IO
(obviously) it cannot use "ranges" property. Because DT pcie nodes use
"reg" property for specifying BDF address, we cannot use neither "reg"
property for specifying memory range of PCIe config space.

And here I'm lost.

My guess is that proper way is to define "pcie-cfg-aperture" in "soc"
node where would be defined physical address range without any binding
to controller, then extend mbus driver to export API also for PCIe CFG
and add code which dynamically assign slice of this range to some
controller. And then use this new API by pci-mvebu.c to access config
space. But pci-mvebu.c needs to know MBUS_ID() attributes which needs to
be defined somewhere in pcie DT node...

If we have free 256MB in physical address space, then we can implement
it easily. It is just changing _size_ argument. I'm not sure how much
DDR RAM has Orion, but if only 2GB then we should be fine (remaining 2GB
should be enough for all peripherals + 256MB for PCIe config space).

Main issue is that there is no Orion documentation which would describe
how direct mapping of PCIe config space is working.
(see also https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/20220719080807.16729-1-pali@kernel.org/)

So we can only set "size" of the physical config space mapping and if we
choose smaller size then we cannot access upper registers. I do not see
any option how to specify "offset" for physical config space to allow
mapping just one PCI bus.

What we have under full control is virtual address space mapping, so we
can just map only one PCI bus to virtual address space from large 256MB
physical config address space.
