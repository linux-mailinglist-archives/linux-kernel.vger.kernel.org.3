Once you allow ALL the MOK keys to be loaded onto the .machine keyring,
limiting which keys should be loaded will change the existing expected
behavior.  So you indeed would need to define a new config option.

Your patch set links the ".machine" keyring to the
".secondary_trusted_keys" kerying. Based on
IMA_KEYRINGS_PERMIT_SIGNED_BY_BUILTIN_OR_SECONDARY config being
enabled, determines whether IMA trusts the secondary keyring.

From IMA_KEYRINGS_PERMIT_SIGNED_BY_BUILTIN_OR_SECONDARY:
        help
          Keys may be added to the IMA or IMA blacklist keyrings, if
the
          key is validly signed by a CA cert in the system built-in or
          secondary trusted keyrings.

          Intermediate keys between those the kernel has compiled in
and the
          IMA keys to be added may be added to the system secondary
keyring,
          provided they are validly signed by a key already resident in
the
          built-in or secondary trusted keyrings.

A dependency to prevent enabling this configuration, if the ".machine"
keyring is enabled, would need to be defined.

thanks,

Mimi
