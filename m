Sorry, I did not understand what you meant.

We no longer explicitly enable OMAP_GPMC since we dropped the "select".
This fixes all build issues that were reported recently.

MTD_NAND_OMAP2 will not be enabled if OMAP_GPMC is not since we added
the "depends on". This fixes the original build issue that we started to
fix with select initially.

This issue is still present i.e. we cannot enable MTD_NAND_OMAP2 driver on
K3 platform since OMAP_GPMC config is hidden and not select-able
by user or defconfig file.

But it is not yet a deal breaker since NAND on K3 is not yet enabled upstream.

For this I think OMAP_GPMC has to be a visible config entry and select-able
from a defconfig file as I had done initially [1].

Now we have a lot of explanation to write as to why we need to do it ;)
