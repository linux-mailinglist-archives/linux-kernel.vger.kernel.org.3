In the bug report you suspect a firmware issue.  Any idea what that
might be?  It looks like a Gemini Lake Root Port, so I wouldn't think
it would be a hardware issue.

Weird how things come in clumps.  Was just looking at Mario's patch,
which also has to do with bridges and D3.

Do we need a Fixes line?  E.g.,

  Fixes: 14858dcc3b35 ("PCI: Use pci_update_current_state() in pci_enable_device_flags()")

Is this bridge_d3_blacklist[] similar to the PCI_DEV_FLAGS_NO_D3 bit?
Could they be folded together?  We have a lot of bits that seem
similar but maybe not exactly the same (dev->bridge_d3,
dev->no_d3cold, dev->d3cold_allowed, dev->runtime_d3cold,
PCI_DEV_FLAGS_NO_D3, pci_bridge_d3_force, etc.)  Ugh.

bridge_d3_blacklist[] itself was added by 85b0cae89d52 ("PCI:
Blacklist power management of Gigabyte X299 DESIGNARE EX PCIe ports"),
which honestly looks kind of random, i.e., it doesn't seem to be
working around a hardware or even a firmware defect.

Apparently the X299 issue is that 00:1c.4 is connected to a
Thunderbolt controller, and the BIOS keeps the Thunderbolt controller
powered off unless something is attached to it?  At least, 00:1c.4
leads to bus 05, and in the dmesg log attached to [1] shows no devices
on bus 05.

It also says the platform doesn't support PCIe native hotplug, which
matches what Mika said about it using ACPI hotplug.  If a system is
using ACPI hotplug, it seems like maybe *that* should prevent us from
putting things in D3cold?  How can we know whether ACPI hotplug
depends on a certain power state?
