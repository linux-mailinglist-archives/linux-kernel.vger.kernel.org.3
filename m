With current applications, it isn't that there is real "MSI storage"
anywhere; the device on the other side of the bridge is always another
Linux host which holds the address (or rather mw offset) and data in
memory to use when it needs to trigger the interrupt of the other
machine. There are many prototypes and proprietary messes that try to
have other PCI devices (ie NVMe, etc) behind the non-transparent bridge;
but the Linux subsystem has no support for this.

Perhaps, I don't really know much about IMS or how close a match it is.

No, but for current applications there are plenty of doorbells.

Switchtec hardware (and I think other hardware) typically have 64
doorbells for the entire network (they must be split among the number of
hosts in the network; a two host system could have 32 per host). The NTB
subsystem in Linux only currently supports 2 hosts, but switchtec
hardware supports up to 48 hosts, in which case you might only have 1
doorbell per host and that might be limiting depending on the application.
