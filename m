Hi, Bjorn
Thanks for your comments.

The problem occurs on ACPI systems.

[    7.739359] acpi PNP0A08:00: _OSC: OS supports [ExtendedConfig ASPM ClockPM Segments MSI EDR HPX-Type3]
[    7.749238] acpi PNP0A08:00: _OSC: platform does not support [SHPCHotplug AER LTR DPC]
[    7.757609] acpi PNP0A08:00: _OSC: OS now controls [PCIeHotplug PME PCIeCapability]


We clear HPIE and CCIE here because the firmware doesn't control Hotplug via __OSC.

And on ACPI systems, we can also set pcie_ports=native, which will also encounter such problems.
