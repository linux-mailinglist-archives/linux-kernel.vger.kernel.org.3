Well right now the Android code looks the cleanest and should be about
ready to be merged into my tree.

But I can almost guarantee that that interface is not what anyone else
wants to use, so if you think somehow that everyone else is going to
want to deal with a char device node and a simple mmap, with a DT
description of the thing, hey, I'm all for it :)

Seriously, people need to come up with something sane or this is going
to be a total mess.
