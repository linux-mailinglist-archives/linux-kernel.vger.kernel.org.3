You won't see any edma register offset because no one bothered to define it
since it was not used until now. But the memory region should've been
documented...

Anyway, here is the offset for the Qcom SoC I'm currently working on:

DBI  - 0x0
iATU - 0x1000
eDMA - 0x2000

As you can see, these offsets doesn't really fit in both the cases you shared
above.

I don't have the knowledge about the internal representation of the IP or what
customization Qcom did apart from some high level information.

Hope this clarifies!

Thanks,
Mani
