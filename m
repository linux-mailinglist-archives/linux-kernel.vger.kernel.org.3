Sorry no, it is too late. I have already lost interested in it. For me
it is like a ride on the dead horse.

Now I have replied to one example email without a reaction. Another
example is this https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/pull/64
which completely blocked any improvements which I proposed in PCIe core
code for fixing PCIe state machine. After half of year of waiting I
decided to stop any work on this as I see it is dead those schemas.
Other examples are that received feedback suggest to do change which
does not work on the real hardware. So yes, I cannot accept, expect or
want something like that. Schema which works in that ultra-supper-duper
software but DTS written according to it does not work on the real
hardware is for me useless...

It just took lot of my time and did nothing useful. Hence for it it has
zero value.
