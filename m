As in NTSC just uses different pixel clock and horizontal/vertical sync
rate values...

625 lines - 575[*] visible lines = 50 lines.

[*] BT.656 uses 576 visible lines as that's a multiple of 2, for splitting
     a frame in two fields of equal size.

"visible" is relative, as it includes the overscan region.
Some PAL monitors used with computers had knobs to control width/height
and position of the screen, so you could make use of most or all of
the overscan region, but on a real TV you're limited to ca. 640x512 (on
PAL)  which is what an Amiga used by default (with a 14 MHz pixclock).

"Field Synchronization of PAL System" on http://martin.hinner.info/vga/pal.html
shows the split.
