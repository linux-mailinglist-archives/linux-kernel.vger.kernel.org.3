I see. OK, Chengming's code makes sense. But we should make the commit
message more clear. Something like:

<draft>
module_put() is not called for a patch with "forced" flag. It should
block the removal of the livepatch module when the code might still
be in use after forced transition.

klp_force_transition() currently sets "force" flag for all patches on
the list.

In fact, any patch can be safely unloaded when it passed through
the consistency model in KLP_UNPATCHED transition.

By other words, the "forced" flag must be set only for livepatches
that are being removed. In particular, set the "forced" flag:

  + only for klp_transition_patch when the transition to KLP_UNPATCHED
    state was forced.

  + all replaced patches when the transition to KLP_PATCHED state was
    forced and the patch was replacing the existing patches.
</draft>

It means that we should could actually do:

	if (klp_target_state == KLP_UNPATCHED) {
		klp_transition_patch->forced = true;
	} else if (klp_transition_patch->replace) {
		klp_for_each_patch(patch) {
			if (patch != klp_transition_patch)
				patch->forced = true;
		}
	}

Huh, that is tricky ;-)

Petr
