Ok, v1/v2 consistency is a valid point.

As I said, I'm fine with both options, it shouldn't matter that much
for anything except the memory controller: cgroup internal objects are not
that large and the total memory footprint is usually small unless we have
a lot of (dying) sub-cgroups. From my experience no other controllers
should be affected (blkcg was affected due to a cgwb reference, but should
be fine now), so it's not an issue at all.

Thanks!
