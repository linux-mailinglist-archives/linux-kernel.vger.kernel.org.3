Unfortunately, I'm not a Qualcomm engineer and in no way affiliated with
them. So I probably can't convince them otherwise. Believe me, I'd like
to :/

First: The uefisecapp-driver is based on reverse-engineering. So please
take things below with a grain of salt, I may be wrong. I've tried to
lay this out in a bit more detail in patch 3, but I'll try to be more
precise here:

For some reason unknown to me, Qualcomm decided to lock away UEFI
variable access via their TrEE framework for applications running in the
TrustZone (or whatever that is exactly). To call to TrEE applications
(like uefisecapp), they use SCM calls. Those SCM calls unfortunately can
be a bit more complex. As far as I can tell, you essentially call to
some hypervisor in the TrustZone which redistributes them (if necessary)
to the respective application. Their downstream driver for that is at
[1] and supports callbacks and re-entrant calls. As far as I can tell,
the latter means that you can't run multiple SCM calls in parallel (at
least not to that TzOS/TrEE interface) and can only ever have one
"client" performing them.

And as you can only ever have one entity performing those SCM calls, you
cannot have both UEFI and the kernel doing them. To me, it seems to be a
deliberate decision by Qualcomm to return EFI_UNSUPPORTED from the
GetVariable etc. calls after exiting boot services. They do work just
fine before that. Essentially exiting boot services transfers ownership
of that SCM interface from UEFI to the kernel.

Note: uefisecapp is also not the only TrEE application in use by those
kinds of devices. For example, on the SC8180X based Surface Pro X that
I'm using, there are at least an app for the TPM, a bunch of apps for
HDCP, some winsecapp, and as far as I can tell also other cryptographic
interfaces. I've tried to collect my findings about those in [2].

It looks like Microsoft accepts this. They even seem to have some sort
of interface for EFI variables via trusted execution environments: [3].
This is essentially what the QcTrEE8180.sys driver I've reverse
engineered this from seems to provide.

So unless there's some way to make EFI variables work via the standard
functions that I've missed, I don't see any alternatives. I think it's
fairly unlikely that we can convince Qualcomm to make their UEFI
implementation behave properly (variables are not the only issue, it
seems that other functions are either partially or completely broken in
some way or another...) and then also push updates for a bunch of
devices (e.g. the Lenovo C630 also using this stuff is discontinued, as
far as I can tell).

I am open to suggestions though...

Note that this series also doesn't really introduce a new interface for
EFI variables themselves to the kernel. It relies on the existing
efivars_register() / efivars_unregister() functions and the interface
provided by them to enable access to EFI variables. So we already do
have a "workaround" for broken UEFI variable access in the kernel.

Max
