For both of the above two comments, please refer to the latest test
result in Patchv2 I have sent. I prefer to name my change as focus
transfer under pressure as protected memcg is the focus when system's
memory pressure is low which will reclaim from root, this is not
against current design. However, when global memory pressure is high,
then the focus has to be changed to the whole system, because it
doesn't make sense to let the protected memcg out of everybody, it
can't
do anything when the system is trapped in the kernel with reclaiming work.

ok, I will hold until all question done.
