Expectation is not the same as having a specification saying it will not
change.

Such approach is not "normal" for third-party devices. Compatible for
devices has model number. If the block has specification, then v2 would
have sense, otherwise you would invent own versioning...

I would say that firmware implementation can easily change. How much of
your code is tied to it, I don't know, but argument "I don't expect
Qualcomm to change something in their firmware" is not the correct argument.

Why bunch? All devices could bind to one specific compatible, as they
are compatible.

And how do you differentiate that qcom_scm_is_available() failed because
it is not yet available (defer probe) or it is broken and will never
load? All regular consumer-provider interfaces have it sorted out.

The Tegra choice is not complete, but it implements at least parts of it
and firmware dependencies are modeled in DTS. Other way would be to add
your device as child of SMC firmware and then you do not need bindings
at all...

Yes, that's better example than Tegra BPMP.
