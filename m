Okay now that's clearing up my mind, makes me see the issue that was raised in
a different perspective. I've finally got it, and Krzysztof is definitely right
about that, as in the proposed solution raises potential future issues and
definitely cannot be considered for merging.

I should've sent this as a RFC instead; this topic is becoming larger than I
could foresee in the short term.

Thanks Krzysztof for raising this flag, and thank you Nic for finding a way to
wake up the hamster in my brain :-P

I didn't consider that kind of solution (adding yet one more function just for
the fast_io case, or wrapping the current ones) exactly because of the reasons
that you just explained...

...if we do that, we're going to also see issues like:
- Client #1 calls syscon fast-io, Client #2 is not converted
- Client #1 is expected to probe earlier than Client #2
- Probe order changes
- Now Client #1 also isn't fast-io

...unless reinitializing regmap mmio (regmap_init_mmio), but this would obviously
be a no-go, because races are under the *nearest* corner at that point. So.. no.

...but then that would still be a software construct and we'd be talking about
the same thing again, just in a different context.

I've also been thinking of adding a way to change the regmap locking on-the-fly
without having to re-init fully, but that also looks like being a no-go, as I
can foresee racing with that solution as well.

By the way, Let me give you some full-er context here, so that you can fully
understand, without any doubt, what I'm trying to do...

Here, on MediaTek SoCs, the HW ABI is in "full IP blocks" (warning: this "term"
may be wrong, but bear with me), for which we see each MMIO range having clocks,
resets, and other IP-specific registers, and sometimes these are "mixed" together.
There's no way to declare a small MMIO sub-range for just clocks, hence syscon is
really the only (relatively?) clean solution that can be used.

Thing is, MTK platforms are continuously locking/unlocking mutexes for simple and
fast operations, even "turning on/off" a clock (actually, due to the nature of the
clock tree for these SoCs, it's always more than one clock at once, so it's always
more than one mutex lock/unlock...), or operating on XHCI registers, etc etc etc.
This gives *a lot* of overhead and you can really experience the stutter sometimes,
and I mean experience with your own eyes, even on more performant chips...

I then checked some other non-MTK platforms, and I saw that it's not really just a
MTK thing (even though it's the heaviest user of syscon between the ones that I
checked)... so I saw a nice improvement pointer for lots of platforms... and I'm
sure that you immediately got that part.

I'm starting to get confused about what could be a good and acceptable solution
here, because at this point there are a lot of blockers around for any different
thing I can think of.

Regards,
Angelo
