I don't expect a new posting of the patches in response to every
question, but hopefully this is a conversation that goes both ways,
and there's no need to slow down the conversation.  It's more than
acceptable to simply ask and answer questions and post updated patches
later.  We're running out of runway and I want to make sure we get
this thing done this cycle.
