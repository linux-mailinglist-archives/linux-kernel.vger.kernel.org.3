The first question is whether it should go in the slot/port node for
apcie or the device node, the second question is whether it should be
generic or just specific to apcie :)

But the d3cold concept *is* defined by PCIe specs. See PCIe 4.0
5.3.1.4.2. "D3cold State".

Could certainly do it as a regulator, yes, though that still leaves the
question of what node to put it in. If it goes in the device node we
still have the chicken and egg problem with device probing.

Right, that it does.

The card detect is also hooked up to a PMU GPIO accessible via SMC which
has interrupt capability (which is not in that driver yet but I will add
that :-)). We can use that in conjunction with or in replacement of the
internal card detect.

It's a PCI thing. See Documentation/power/pci.txt for a discussion of
the various PCI power states. This is already part of the API, e.g.
pci_d3cold_enable and friends. Given how d3cold works today on existing
ACPI systems, I think it makes a lot more sense to add that to the PCI
port nodes (whether as a GPIO or a regulator, I don't really care) and
hook it up to that plumbing, rather than try to make the downstream
device driver reinvent that wheel. The PCI core needs to know about
d3cold transitions to save/restore certain config space registers. And
as far as I know this is all hooked up to runtime-pm, so if a driver
enables d3cold and runtime-pm the device can be powered down by the PCI
core when not in use.

So it'd go something like this:

- apcie driver, on slot activation, sees a pwren gpio/reg and powers it
on prior to bringing up the link (and marks that port as d3cold supported)
- sdhci-pci driver, on probe, sees an external card detect GPIO declared
and considers that license to call pci_d3cold_enable and enable
runtime-pm (since it won't need the internal card detect IRQ/GPIO)
- No SD card is inserted, so SD driver goes into runtime suspend and
saves whatever controller state it needs
- PCI core saves whatever config space stuff it needs to save, SD
controller is powered down via GPIO
- SD card is inserted, SMC GPIO IRQ notifies SD driver
- SD driver goes out of runtime suspend
- PCI core powers on controller, re-establishes link, restores config space
- SD driver restores host controller registers and discovers the new card

No new APIs, this is all existing kernel stuff. PCI manages slot power
same as it does on ACPI systems (that support it), driver interacts with
it via runtime-pm and the d3cold control stuff.

I'm tempted to prototype this today and see how it goes...
