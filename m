An artificial test case is not much useful. We would like to know if you
met the problem in the real life. It would be great to know more
details if it really happened.

What is the motivation for the timeout, please?

The "force" functionality was introduced as a last resort solution.
It might be useful when the transition gets blocked and another
transition is needed.

"force" should be used carefully. Users should be sure that it is
really safe in the current state.

Note that forced transition does not magically makes the system
patched. If a process is sleeping on a non-patched function then
it will continue running the old code until it returns
the non-patched function.
