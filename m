Can you collect the complete dmesg and lspci output, please?

From hints on the web, I guess the ASM2824 is built-in to the SiFive
board, right?  So I suspect the topology is something like this:

  00:00.0 Root Port to [bus 01-??]                  # soldered on to Unmatched
  01:00.0 ASM2824 Upstream Port to [bus 02-09]      # soldered on
  02:03.0 ASM2824 Downstream Port to [bus 05-09]    # soldered on, to slot
  05:00.0 PI7C9X2G304 Upstream Port to [bus 06-09]  # on Delock riser card
  06:??.? PI7C9X2G304 Downstream Port to [bus ??]   # slot 0 on Delock card
  06:??.? PI7C9X2G304 Downstream Port to [bus ??]   # slot 1 on Delock card

Do we have other reports of this bridge being broken?  Or could this
be some kind of signal integrity problem on Unmatched or the slot?

The ASM2824 has been around for a while and seems to be used in other
systems, e.g., https://linux-hardware.org/?id=pci:1b21-2824, so if
it's an ASM2824 issue, we should see it elsewhere, too.

I think the above is supposed to show 02:03.0 operating at 5GT/s or
2.5GT/s, and 05:00.0 operating at 2.5GT/s.  But there's a lot of noise
that makes it hard to pick out what's important.

Please include a URL for this commit.  Without knowing where to use
it, the SHA1 by itself isn't much use.

Perhaps a place to use pcie_retrain_link() (would require a little
rework to make it usable outside aspm.c).

We only add to pci_ids.h when the ID is used in more than one place.
