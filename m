Of course a code signing CA certificate should not also be a
certificate signing key (keyCertSign).  Remember the
"builtin_trusted_keys" and "secondary_trusted_keys" keyrings are
special.  Their root of trust is based on a secure boot signature chain
of trust up to and including a signed kernel image.  The "machine"
keyring is totally different in this regard.  Establishing a new root
of trust is really difficult.  Requiring a root-CA to have key
certifcate signing usage is a level of indirection, which I would
consider a small price to pay for being able to establish a, hopefully
safe or at least safer, new root of trust for trusting "end-user" keys.

Your cover letter should say that this patch series enables
verification of 3rd party modules.
