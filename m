With suppress_bind_attrs, the user can't manually unbind a device, so
we can't get to mvebu_pcie_remove() that way, but since mvebu is a
modular driver, I assume we can unload the module and *that* would
call mvebu_pcie_remove().  Right?

Hmmm.  Based on your patches below, it looks like we need to call
irq_dispose_mapping() in some cases, but I'm very confused about
*which* cases.

I first thought it was for mappings created with irq_create_mapping(),
but pci-aardvark.c never calls that, so there must be more to it.

Currently only altera, iproc, mediatek-gen3, and mediatek call
irq_dispose_mapping() from their .remove() methods.  (They all call
irq_domain_remove() *before* irq_dispose_mapping().  Is that legal?
Your patches do irq_dispose_mapping() *first*.)

altera, mediatek-gen3, and mediatek call irq_dispose_mapping() on IRQs
that came from platform_get_irq().

qcom is a DWC driver, so all the IRQ stuff happens in
dw_pcie_host_init().  qcom_pcie_remove() does call
dw_pcie_host_deinit(), which calls irq_domain_remove(), but nobody
calls irq_dispose_mapping().

I'm thoroughly confused by all this.  But I suspect that maybe I
should drop the "make qcom modular" patch because it seems susceptible
to this problem:

I'm not smart enough to do "more detailed review" because I don't know
what things to look for :)  Thanks for all your work in sorting out
these arcane details!
