Well, the current behavior of jackpoll is intentional, so that it
avoids the unnecessary power up at the runtime PM suspend.  And your
requirement is rather opposite, and it's not Tegra-specific at all --
you just prefer the jack notification over the power saving.

So, implementing the feature in HD-audio core side would make more
sense (and it's simpler), something like below.

BTW, which codec needs this?  If it's about HDMI, doesn't the audio
component work?  At least nouveau has it, and I thought Nvidia binary
driver does poke the driver at hotplug by opening the proc file or
such.
