Sorry for the noise. I read 'elf.h' as 'efi.h' :/

But it also includes <linux/bitmap.h> indirectly:

In file included from include/linux/elf.h:6:
In file included from arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h:8:

Yes.

for_each_clear_bitrange() is pain to unwind.

I will push what I have a bit later today.

I understand where you comes from. But on my side I face suddenly higher
entry bar. Yes, it is bad excuse, I know.

I'm okay with this. But I lack coherent understating on how you want it
to look like.

Like, looking on your new "efi.h", I see it still implicitly depends on
<linux/types.h> and <linux/uuid.h>. Why is it okay? Is it temporary? What
is criteria of what is okay to keep for now?

You mentioned having <asm/shared/bitops.h> as we do <asm/shared/io.h>. But
<asm/bitops.h> has non-trivial dependencies on its own.

Okay, we can move them into asm/shared as well, but how to deal with
asm-generic/ things? And linux/ dependencies? Do we create a copy in
x86/include?
