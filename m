This seem to describe the root user. A restrictions of root's power

Is this a scenario of concern? : /usr/bin/foobar is signed by verity and 
there's a rule in the IMA policy that would appraise this file. Can root 
now remove /usr/bin/foobar and copy the regularly signed /usr/bin/bash 
to /usr/bin/foobar along with bash's security.ima and have it execute 
either since there's no appraise rule covering non-fsverity signatures 
or due to a rule that covers non-fsverity signatures?

Since the signature header of security.ima is not signed root could also 
just rewrite the header and modify the signature type (and also version) 
and circumvent appraisal rules specific to fsverity.

I am trying to figure out a concrete scenario that one has to defend 
against what seems to be the power of the root user. A more concrete 
example may be helpful.
