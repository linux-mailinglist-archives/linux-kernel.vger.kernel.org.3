Just as an idea, we can put info into UTS_VERSION which can be read from
the built bzImage. We have info on SMP and preeption there already.

Patch below does this:

$ file arch/x86/boot/bzImage
arch/x86/boot/bzImage: Linux kernel x86 boot executable bzImage, version 5.19.0-rc3-00016-g2f6aa48e28d9-dirty (kas@box) #2300 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC UNACCEPTED_MEMORY Mon Jun 27 14:23:04 , RO-rootFS, swap_dev 0XC, Normal VGA

Note UNACCEPTED_MEMORY in the output.

Probably we want to have there info on which flavour of unaccepted memory
is supported (TDX/SNP/whatever). It is a bit more tricky.

Any opinion?
