The solution looks a bit hackish to me.

The nvmem_config structure already contains a field named wp_gpio which
seem to imply that callers can provide a wp_gpio handle there if they
want. But yet the nvmem core ignores if no gpio was provided and will
try to get one anyway. Shouldn't this behavior be changed?

There are already a big number of callers for nvmem_register() so I
understand it might be a bit tedious to just drop the else part of
that condition, but maybe we can provide a dummy cookie into the
wp_gpio field which would be interpreted as: "don't mess with it". Or
perhaps an additional flag somewhere else just to clearly skip the
wp_gpio thing entirely?
