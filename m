Well, I have to say I was not a great fan of this patch when it was
proposed but I didn't really have strong arguments against it to nack
it. It was simple enough, rather self contained in few places. Just to
give you an insight into my thinking here. Your patchseries is also not
something I would nack (nor I have done that). I am not super fan of it
either. I voiced against it because it just hit my internal thrashold of
how many different places are patched without any systemic approach. If
we consider that it doesn't really help with the initial intention to
protect against adversaries then what is the point of all the churn?

Others might think differently and if you can get acks by other
maintainers then I won't stand in the way. I have voiced my concerns and
I hope my thinking is clear now.

kernfs is not really my area so I cannot really comment on those.
