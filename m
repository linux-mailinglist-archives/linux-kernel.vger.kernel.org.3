I have one small procedural favor to ask. :)

I couldn't apply your patch series directly. It if isn't too
inconvenient for you could you pass --base with a proper upstream tag,
e.g. --base=v5.15.

The branch you posted here doesn't exist afaict and I had to peruse your
github repo and figured the correct branch might be v5.15+imans.v3.posted.

In any case, --base with a proper upstream tag would make this all a bit
easier or - if it really is necessary to pull from your tree it would be
nice if you could post it in a form directly consumable by git and note
url-escaped. So something like

git clone https://github.com/stefanberger/linux-ima-namespaces v5.15+imans.v3.posted

would already help.
