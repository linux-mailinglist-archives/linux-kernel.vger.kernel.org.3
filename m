The big question is whether there is a memory pressure on those systems.
If yes, and the number of dying cgroups is growing, it's worth investigating.
It might be due to the sharing of pagecache pages and this will be ultimately
fixed with implementing of the pagecache reparenting. But it also might be due
to other bugs, which are fixable, so it would be great to understand.

So if there is a memory pressure and dying cgroups are still accumulating,
we need to investigate and fix it.

If there is (almost) no memory pressure, it's a proactive reclaim question.
There are several discussions and projects going on in this area.

Releasing percpu memory is more a workaround of the problem rather than fix.
In the end, if we're accumulating dying cgroups, we're still leaking memory,
just at a smaller pace (which is good, of course).

Thanks!
