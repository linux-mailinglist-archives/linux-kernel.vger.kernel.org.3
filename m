It was tested now and confirmed that the call path is via AMDGPU, as
expected:
  amdgpu_pci_probe ->
  amdgpu_driver_load_kms ->
  amdgpu_device_init ->
  amdgpu_amdkfd_device_init ->
  kgd2kfd_device_init ->
  kgd2kfd_resume_iommu ->
  kfd_iommu_resume ->
  amd_iommu_init_device ->
  iommu_attach_group ->
  __iommu_attach_group

At first AMDGPU driver is probed, and the iommu_attach_group() call
above changes the assigned group->domain.  Afterwards, when HD-audio
devices are probed, it fails because:
- Both HD-audio PCI devices belong to the very same IOMMU group as the
  AMD graphics PCI device
- PCI core calls iommu_device_use_default_domain() and the check
  fails there because group->domain != group->default_domain
