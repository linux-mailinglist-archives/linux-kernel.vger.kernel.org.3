I think that the race should be possible also with the forward
transition. I do not see what would prevent it.

IMHO, these races might be dangerous only when fork() calls
a function on the way out that is livepatched but it was not
on the stack when the process was copied.

Anyway, the patch should make sure that task->patch_state and
TIF_PATCH_PENTING are always consitent when the child is added
to the global task list. So, we should always be on the safe side.

IMHO, it is because the race during the forward transition is
kind of "self-healing":

parent:				worker:

  fork()
    #copy set TIF_PATCH_PENDING
    # schedule


				  klp_try_complete_transition()
				     clear_bit(parent, TIF_PATCH_PENDING);
				     parent->patch_state = klp_target_state;

   # running again
   # copy already migrated parent->patch_state



later:

     clear_bit(child, TIF_PATCH_PENDING);
     child->patch_state = klp_target_state;

As a result, child->patch_state will be updated twice
to klp_target_state.



The problematic situation during revert:


parent:					another process:

   # migrate parent
   clear_bit(parent, TIF_PATCH_PENDING);
   parent->patch_state = klp_target_state;

   fork()
     #copy cleared TIF_PATCH_PENDING

					klp_revert_patch()
					    # invert @klp_target_state
					    set_bit(parent, TIF_PATCH_PENDING)

     # copy parent->patch_state that
       needs migration once again

   # migrated once again after revert
   clear_bit(parent, TIF_PATCH_PENDING);
   parent->patch_state = klp_target_state;

WARNING: child will never get migrated because it copied the cleared
	 TIF_PATCH_PENDING before @klp_target_state was inverted

Resume:

It is great that the race was found and fixed.

Best Regards,
Petr
