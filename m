I know it's not set yet as-is; I'm suggesting things should be 
restructured so that it *would be*. In the logical design of this code, 
the DMA addresses are effectively determined in iommu_dma_map_sg(), and 
__finalise_sg() merely converts them from a relative to an absolute form 
(along with undoing the other trickery). Thus the call to 
pci_p2pdma_map_bus_segment() absolutely belongs in the main 
iommu_map_sg() loop.

I'd say a check for zero-length segments would look like "if (sg->length 
== 0)", most likely with a "continue;" on the following line.

I was thinking more of sg_is_dma_bus_address() but admittedly under my 
initial misapprehension of that. I suppose there's still a tenuous 
argument that even though we're not actually consuming sg_dma_address() 
at that point, if a segment *has* been earmarked for direct p2p, then 
skipping it rather than mapping it at the root complex TA that's 
probably never going to see those transactions might seem the more 
logical choice.

However it's all a bit hypothetical, and not significantly cleaner than 
a zero-size special case, so I'm not particularly tied to the idea either.

"The scatterlist segments" means all of them, including any p2p ones 
which are demonstrably not mapped into anything. The extra logic 
required to skip non-mapped p2p segments goes beyond "incredibly easy". 
If there's one thing I *do* definitely understand, it's my own comments ;)
