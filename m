I fully agree with you here on the design level. Firmware _should_ be
discoverable. Unfortunately, in this case it really isn't.

Again, in Windows, this information is stored via the Registry and set
when the driver is installed. An example:

     ; UEFIVAR SECURE APP SERVICE
     HKR,%EFIVarService.RegKey%,Enabled,%REG_DWORD%,1
     HKR,%EFIVarService.RegKey%,MajorVersion,%REG_DWORD%,1
     HKR,%EFIVarService.RegKey%,MinorVersion,%REG_DWORD%,0
     
     ; WINSECAPP SECURE APP SERVICE
     HKR,%WinSecAppService.RegKey%,Enabled,%REG_DWORD%,1
     HKR,%WinSecAppService.RegKey%,SecureApp,%REG_DWORD%,1
     HKR,%WinSecAppService.RegKey%,LoadApp,%REG_DWORD%,0
     HKR,%WinSecAppService.RegKey%,AppName,,"qcom.tz.winsecapp"
     HKR,%WinSecAppService.RegKey%,MajorVersion,%REG_DWORD%,1
     HKR,%WinSecAppService.RegKey%,MinorVersion,%REG_DWORD%,0
     HKR,%WinSecAppService.RegKey%,OSDependencies,%REG_MULTI_SZ%,%RpmbOsService%
     
     ; HDCP v2.2 SECURE APP SERVICE
     HKR,%Hdcp2p2Service.RegKey%,Enabled,%REG_DWORD%,1
     HKR,%Hdcp2p2Service.RegKey%,SecureApp,%REG_DWORD%,1
     HKR,%Hdcp2p2Service.RegKey%,LoadApp,%REG_DWORD%,1
     HKR,%Hdcp2p2Service.RegKey%,AppName,,"qcom.tz.hdcp2p2"
     HKR,%Hdcp2p2Service.RegKey%,FileName,,"hdcp2p2.mbn"
     HKR,%Hdcp2p2Service.RegKey%,MajorVersion,%REG_DWORD%,1
     HKR,%Hdcp2p2Service.RegKey%,MinorVersion,%REG_DWORD%,0
     HKR,%Hdcp2p2Service.RegKey%,OSDependencies,%REG_MULTI_SZ%,%RpmbOsService%,%TzAppsOsService%

The '.RegKey' contains a GUID that specifies the _driver_ interface that
is registered by the driver to the kernel (i.e. is not related to the
specific firmware and firmware version), e.g. [1]. For uefisecapp, the
driver also maps this GUID to the name-string.

I can see your point. But this interface has apparently been around
since at least sdm850 (e.g. Lenovo C630) and hasn't changed. As I've
argued elsewhere: All parties involved have a vested interest that this
interface doesn't change in a breaking way. The interface is modeled
similar to syscalls, so I very much expect them to extend it if needed,
instead of changing/breaking it.

Sure, it _could_ be changed in a breaking way. But again, I believe that
to be _very_ unlikely.

If we have user-space available at the time when these things should be
loaded or if they are more or less optional, sure.

Again, I fully agree with you that this situation shouldn't exist. But
reality is sadly different.
