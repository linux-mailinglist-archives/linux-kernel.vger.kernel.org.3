Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking.

Many thx for directly getting regzbot involved! :-D

Only internally? Or are there any other related public discussions that
are relevant to this and thus good to be aware of?

The answer from my point is simple: it needs to be fixed in the kernel,
not just in the firmware, otherwise people that update the kernel
without updating the firmware at the same time will run into a
regression -- and that is not acceptable by kernel development standards.

Ciao, Thorsten

P.S.: As a Linux kernel regression tracker I'm getting a lot of reports
on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them. Unfortunately
therefore I sometimes will get things wrong or miss something important.
I hope that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to
tell me about it in a public reply. That's in everyone's interest, as
what I wrote above might be misleading to everyone reading this; any
suggestion I gave they thus might sent someone reading this down the
wrong rabbit hole, which none of us wants.

BTW, I have no personal interest in this issue, which is tracked using
regzbot, my Linux kernel regression tracking bot
(https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/). I'm only posting
this mail to get things rolling again and hence don't need to be CC on
all further activities wrt to this regression.
