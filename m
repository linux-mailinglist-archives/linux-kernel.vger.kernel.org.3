It's worth noting that if fs-verity built-in signatures are used, a trusted
userspace program is still required to determine and enforce the policy of which
files are required to be signed.  The kernel only handles the actual signature
verification.  This was basically a proof-of-concept which reused the kernel's
module signature verification code (which happens to use PKCS#7).

I'd encourage new users to either go all-in on a userspace solution, using a
trusted userspace program to verify signatures of fs-verity file digests;
*or* go all-in on an in-kernel solution, using the IMA support for fs-verity
which Mimi Zohar is working on.  A userspace solution could use a simple
signature format, using a modern algorithm such as Ed25519.  IMA uses a simple
signature format too, though it uses a complex format (X.509) for public keys.
