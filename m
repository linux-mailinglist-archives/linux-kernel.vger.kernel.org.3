I agree that MSI is generally to be preferred over INTx.  In this
case, it's an old USB device and I don't think there's any real
performance benefit.

The problem with enabling MSI on these USB devices is that the generic
MSI code doesn't work correctly.  Since we've been using them without
MSI in the past, and they have some defect that makes MSI not work
correctly, it seems like the simplest solution is to avoid using MSI,
something like the patch below.

Would I prefer the same for all the other existing users of
PCI_DEV_FLAGS_MSI_INTX_DISABLE_BUG?  Yes.  Enough to change the status
quo, which would be a performance regression, and potentially break
something?  Probably not.
