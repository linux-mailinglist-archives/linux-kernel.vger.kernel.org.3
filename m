I still think that hiding the code in firmware because the hardware is
broken is absolutely the wrong way to tackle this problem and I thought
the general idea from last time was that we were going to teach Linux
about the broken hardware instead [1]. I'd rather have the junk where we
can see it, reason about it and modify it.

What's changed?

In my mind, the main thing that's happened since we last discussed this
is that Apple shipped arm64 client hardware with working ECAM. *Apple*
for goodness sake: a company with basically no incentive to follow
standards for their vertically integrated devices! Perhaps others need
to raise their game instead of wasting everybody's time on firmware
hacks; getting the hardware right obviously isn't as difficult as folks
would lead us to believe.
