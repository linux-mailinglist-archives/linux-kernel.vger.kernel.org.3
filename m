Not exactly, there are already many such build flags being used currently across kernel.

Example: "-D__KVM_NVHE_HYPERVISOR__, D__KVM_VHE_HYPERVISOR__,
-D__NO_FORTIFY, -D__DISABLE_EXPORTS, -DDISABLE_BRANCH_PROFILING".

It gives us even more flexibility to disable feature for multiple files under a directory
rather than individually cluttering each file, look at "-D__KVM_NVHE_HYPERVISOR__"
for files under "arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/nvhe/".

How is this cleaner, lets say we have many such drivers like all drivers under drivers/serial,
so we go and add #define for each of them? That looks more spread out than having all
such information under one file (Makefile).

And I didn't understand how is it harder to track changes to makefile? Makefile isÂ  part
of the driver directory and any changes to makefile is visible to the corresponding maintainers.
Do you mean something else?

That can be done later on top of this series right? This series mainly deals with adding
initial support for such tracing, there could be numerous drivers who might or might
not want the feature which can be added onto later. We can't actually identify all
the driver requirements upfront. As an example, we have already used the flag to
disable tracing for nVHE KVM, so we know how to use the flag.

Every driver except those two or few more, and it is not a bug or anything, they just want to disable it
to limit the logs in case of example UART driver since the reads/writes are very frequent in those cases
and the logs are not necessarily useful for them.
