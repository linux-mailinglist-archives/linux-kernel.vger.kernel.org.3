That makes sense for regular interrupt controllers where its hard to
tell that all consumers are gone, but I don't think that should limit
the usefulness of having modular PCI controller drivers where we know
that the consumers are gone after deregistering the bus (i.e. the
consumers are descendants of the controller in the device tree).

We obviously agree that modular driver are important (e.g. for
multi-platform kernels), but being able to unload a module is also a
useful debugging and development tool. I've fixed several driver bugs in
paths that are rarely tested (or hard to test) by unloading the
pcie-qcom driver.

This old quote from Linus seems to agree with my position on this:

	The proper thing to do (and what we _have_ done) is to say
	"unloading of modules is not supported". It's a debugging
	feature, and you literally shouldn't do it unless you are
	actively developing that module.

	https://lore.kernel.org/all/Pine.LNX.4.58.0401251054340.18932@home.osdl.org/

But of course we should fix any issues we find, such as the missing
unmapping of legacy interrupts pointed out by Pali earlier in this
thread.

Sure, but I think it would be the wrong decision here. Especially, since
the end result will likely just be that more drivers will become always
compiled-in.

And it's primarily a debugging feature.

But that was arguably due to a driver bug, which we know how to fix. For
MSIs the endpoint driver will free its interrupts and all is good.

The key observation is that the driver model will make sure that any
endpoint drivers have been unbound before the bus is deregistered.

That means there are no longer any consumers of the interrupts, which
can be disposed. For MSI this is handled by pci_free_irq_vectors() when
unbinding the endpoint drivers. For legacy interrupts, which can be
shared, the PCIe RC driver needs to manage this itself after the
consumers are gone.

The OF mapping is typically done by PCI core when binding the endpoint
driver, but as the interrupts can be shared, they cannot be disposed at
unbind.

Instead the host-bridge driver needs to dispose the mappings after
deregistering the bus and before removing the domain, as in Pali's
fixes:

	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220709161858.15031-1-pali@kernel.org/

at which point the consumers are gone.
