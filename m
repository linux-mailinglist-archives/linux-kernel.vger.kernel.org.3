I wish I knew how to really interpret those "ranges" properties.  (Is
there a good description in Documentation/ somewhere?  All I've found
so far is https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Usage, which is good, but
doesn't match this example completely.)

I see:

  pciec: pcie {
    ranges = <...>;
    pcie1: pcie@1,0 {
      ranges = <0x82000000 0 0 0x82000000 0x1 0 1 0
	        0x81000000 0 0 0x81000000 0x1 0 1 0>;
    };
    pcie2: pcie@2,0 {
      ranges = <0x82000000 0 0 0x82000000 0x2 0 1 0
	        0x81000000 0 0 0x81000000 0x2 0 1 0>;
    };
    pcie3: pcie@3,0 {
      ranges = <0x82000000 0 0 0x82000000 0x3 0 1 0
	        0x81000000 0 0 0x81000000 0x3 0 1 0>;
    };
    pcie4: pcie@4,0 {
      ranges = <0x82000000 0 0 0x82000000 0x4 0 1 0
	        0x81000000 0 0 0x81000000 0x4 0 1 0>;
    };
  };

What does this look like in dmesg, i.e., what CPU address ranges are
mapped to what PCI bus addresses?

Are pcie1, pcie2, etc Root Ports?  Or are they each separate host
bridges (they each have "bus-range = <0x00 0xff>")?

Is space from pciec dynamically assigned to pcie1, pcie2, etc?  If so,
I assume there are more restrictions on the size and alignment than on
PCI bridge windows, which allow size/alignment down to 1MB?

I'm trying to see how this could be described in ACPI because that's a
fairly general model that accommodates most machines.  Possibly
describing mvebu in ACPI would involve losing some flexibility.
