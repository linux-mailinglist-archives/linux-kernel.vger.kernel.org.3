Hi, Jan and Jens

I just got response from our IT support:

'fo' is not set in our dmarc configuration(default is 0), which means
SPF and DKIM verify both failed so that emails will end up in spam.

It right that DKIM verify is failed because there is no signed key,
however, our IT support are curious how SPF verify faild.

Can you guys please take a look at ip address of sender? So our IT
support can take a look if they miss it from SPF records.

Thanks,
Kuai
