The easiest thing to do is to use rcu_dereference_sched() instead of
rcu_dereference().  This will cause lockdep to insist on preemption
(for example, interrupts) being disabled.

Or is this a case where a function containing rcu_dereference() is invoked
with interrupts disabled from some call sites and under rcu_read_lock()
protection from other call sites?  In this case, it is usually best to
include that redundant rcu_read_lock() [1].

							Thanx, Paul

[1]	If you are a glutton for punishment, or if you would otherwise
	have to add a cubic goatskin of rcu_read_lock() calls, you
	could instead write this priceless gem in place of the calls to
	rcu_dereference() in that common function:

	p = rcu_dereference_check(ptr, rcu_read_lock_sched_held());

	This would cause lockdep to be happy with either rcu_read_lock()
	or preemption being disabled.

	This is more precise, and would be preferable in some cases,
	for example, if there were lots of hotpath callsites with
	interrupts disabled.  "Do we add 25 pairs of rcu_read_lock()
	and rcu_read_unlock()?	Or do we add just the one ugly
	rcu_dereference_check()?"
