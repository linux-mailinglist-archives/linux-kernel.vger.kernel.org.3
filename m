IIUC, that's part of the hiding mechanism.  See below.

It doesn't reflect what really happens AFAICS.  The devices that
appear to be located below the VMD RCiEP are not there physically.

If the toggle is set to disable VMD, all of the devices that would be
hidden by the firmware and only visible through the VMD mechanisms
show up in their proper locations in the original PCIe hierarchy that
they belong to physically.

[1] is correct.

No, this really is only about re-exposing some of the existing PCIe
hierarchy that was hidden by the firmware from the OS.  Physically, it
is still the same hierarchy all the time.
