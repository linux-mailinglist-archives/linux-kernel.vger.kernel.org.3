You can trigger this by interrupting UBI.
e.g. When UBI writes a new fastmap to the NAND, it schedules the old fastmap
PEBs for erasure. PEB erasure is asynchronous in UBI. So this can be delayed
for a very long time.
While developing UBI fastmap and performing powercut tests I saw this often
on targets.

Yes. But if you look into ubi_wl_init() you see that fastmap anchor PEBs
get erases synchronously(!). The comment before the erasure explains why.
To complicate things, this code is currently unreachable because the WARN_ON()
is not right. I misses to count ai->fastmap.
So, when there are old fastmap PEBs found, the counter does not match
and UBI falls back to full scanning while it could to an attach by fastmap.

Fastmap is full with corner cases that have been found by massive amount of testing, sadly.
