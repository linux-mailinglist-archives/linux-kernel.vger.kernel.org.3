I went these through one by one.

# Above linked patch=20

Boolean parameters are considered bad. I.e. use named flags
instead. This is for above linked patch.

# [PATCH v3 3/4] tpm: Fix test for interrupts

1. Please remove "unnecessarily complicated" sentence because
   it cannot be evaluated. It's your opinion, which might perhaps
   be correct, but it is irrelevant for any possible patch
   description.
2. There's no such thing as "fix by re-implementation". Please
   explain instead code change is relevant for the bug fix.
3. If set_bit() et al necessarily to fix a possible race condition
   you need to have a separate patch for that.

To move forward, start with a better summary such as

"tpm: move interrupt test to tpm_tis_probe_irq_single()"

I'd also either revert the change for flags, or alternatively
move it to separate patch explaining race condition. Otherwise,
there's no argument of saying that using set_bit() is more=20
proper. This will make the change more localized.


# [PATCH v3 2/4] tpm: Simplify locality handling

"As a side-effect these modifications fix a bug which results in the
following warning when using TPM 2:"

Generally speaking, the simplifications should be done on top of code
that does not have known bugs, even if the simplification renders out
the bug. This is because then we have code that have potentially unknown
unknown bugs.

I hope you see my point. The problem with these patches were then
and is still that they intermix bug fixes and other modifications and
thus cannot be taken in.

BR, Jarkko
