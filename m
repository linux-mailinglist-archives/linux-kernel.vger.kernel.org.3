The IMA fs-verity policy rule could require specifying the hash
algorithm.  If it would require specifying a particular key as well,
would hashing the hash then not be needed?

The v2 version of this patch introduces the "ima_tbs_hash" structure,
which is more generic, since it uses the IMA xattr record type.  Other
than that, I don't see a difference.

There seems to be an inconsistency, here, with what you said above,
"... ECDSA just signs/verifies a raw hash, and in fact it *must* be a
raw hash for it to be secure."

The v2 version of this patch set signed the hash of a hash just for fs-
verity signatures.  Adding the equivalent support for regular file
hashes will require the version in the IMA signature_v2_hdr to be
incremented.  If the version is incremented now, both signatures
versions should then be able to co-exist.
