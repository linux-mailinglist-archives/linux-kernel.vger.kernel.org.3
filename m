Yeah, even if, let it crash'n'burn - people will notice pretty quickly.

Good question.

Unfortunately, not even the architects of coco could give you an answer
because, as you see yourself, those additional features like memory
acceptance, live migration, etc keep changing - the whole coco thing is
pretty much a moving target.

For example, if someone comes along and says, err, see, I have this live
migration helper and that thing runs as an EFI executable and it is so
much better...

Not saying it'll happen but it could. I hope you're catching my drift.

Well, I don't want to spoil your idea but imagine distros like SLE or
others backport features into old kernels. All of a sudden 5.14 or older
can do memory acceptance too. And then that version-based scheme falls
apart.

So I'm guessing it would probably be better to explicitly tag distro
images. Thing is, once all needed support gets in, you can drop the tags
and simply say, you don't support those old images anymore and assume
all required support is there and implicit...

I'll do you one better: boot the image and check for all required
features and produce tags. Or do not accept the image as a possible coco
image. And so on.

Thx.
