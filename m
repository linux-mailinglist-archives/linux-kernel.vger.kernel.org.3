Agreed, I will keep this in mind.

Yes sure, download location could be (in order of priority) $PERF_TEST_AUXTRACE_DECODER > $XDG_CACHE_HOME > ~/.cache. I can add a mechanism to override the download step if needed.

Also I think it would make sense for it to be generic/extensible for SPE and PT as well.

Imho best location for Arm files at the moment is github/ARM-software, since we already kind of use it for perf work (the pmu json files, for example). We also have gitlab.arm.com but I'm not very familiar with that one, or if it can be used at all.

Thanks,
German
