That is not how kernel development works. It does not make sense to
introduce code that isn't used. The code is by its nature untested,
and it is completely unknown if it is even going to work if it is ever
needed. We simply can not predict how a future BIOS version / DSDT
looks like.

I don't have an answer for the maintainability problem, but introducing
speculative code is most definitely not the answer.
