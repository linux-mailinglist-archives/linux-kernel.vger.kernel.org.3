Ick, modules and kobjects, just say no :)

I don't want to add module pointers to kobjects.

kobjects are data.  modules are code.  Module references control code
lifespans.  Kobject references control data lifespans.  They are
different, so let us never mix the two please.

Yes, release callbacks are code, but if you really need to worry about
your release callback being unloaded, then just refuse to unload your
module until your data is all released!

The huge majority of kobject users never touch them directly, they use
the driver model, which should not have this issue.  Only code that
wants to touch kobjects in the "raw" have problems like this, and if you
want to mess with them at that level, you can handle the release data
issue.

Then there's the issue of static kobjects that are defined in code
(modules), but are treated as a reference count of data.  ick...
