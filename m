To calrify, I suppose that for ECDSA NIST P256 you would allow pairing 
with any of the SHA family hashes (also as defined by the existing OIDs) 
and as the standard allows today? And the same then applies for NIST 
p384 etc.?

Further, I suppose similar restriction would apply for ECRDSA to pair it 
with Streebog only, as Vitaly said.


What's happening now is that to verify a signature, IMA/integrity 
subsystem fills out the following structure:

struct public_key_signature pks;

pks.hash_algo = hash_algo_name[hdr->hash_algo];  // name of hash algo 
will go into this here, e.g., 'sha256'
pks.pkey_algo = pk->pkey_algo; // this is either 'rsa', 'ecdsa-', 
'ecrdsa-' or 'sm2' string

It then calls:

     ret = verify_signature(key, &pks);

IMO, in the call path down this function the pairing of public key and 
hash algo would have to be enforced in order to enforce the standards. 
Would this not be sufficient to be able to stay with the standards ?

File hashes: IMA calculates the hash over a file itself by calling 
crypto functions, so at least the digest's bytes are trusted input in 
that respect and using the sha family type of hashes directly with ECDSA 
should work. Which algorithm IMA is supposed to use for the hashing is 
given in the xattr bytestream header. IMA could then take that type of 
hash, lookup the hash function, perform the hashing on the data, and let 
verify_signature enforce the pairing, rejecting file signatures with 
wrong pairing. This way the only thing that is needed is 'enforcement of 
pairing'.

Fsverity: How much control does a user have over the hash family 
fsverity is using? Can IMA ECDSA/RSA users tell it to use a sha family 
hash and ECRDSA users make it use a Streebog hash so that also the 
pairing of hash and key type can work 'naturally' and we don't need the 
level of indirection via your structure above?
