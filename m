These leaves are all part of the Management Physical Function(MPF), is it?
But why are they assigned in different groups from software perspective?

I'm not quite understand the neccessity of the group device & driver.

The xleaf devices could be enumerated & managed by one root driver (maybe the
PCIe driver for the card). Why we need group drivers to do it part by part?
Maybe this is the same question as the first one.

There are many ways in kernel for direct communication between two device
drivers according to their functionalies. Is it necessary we introduce a
new mechanism for general communication across all kinds of devices under
xroot?

Do we still need the xrt_bus? Seems it all it does is the OF style device-driver matching. 
From my perspective, the main part of the patchset is to dynamically add some mmio sub
devices under a parent PCI device and they are enumerated by DT overlay. Maybe it is
much easier just implement them as platform devices, then you could leverage the
of/platform enumeration. You could also leverage the drivers for IP blocks that are
already supported. We don't need both the xrt_driver and platform_driver for the same
IP blocks just because they are placed on different boards.

> +Alveo Platform Overview
> +=======================
> +
> +Alveo platforms are architected as two physical FPGA partitions: *Shell* and
> +*User*. The Shell provides basic infrastructure for the Alveo platform like
> +PCIe connectivity, board management, Dynamic Function Exchange (DFX), sensors,
> +clocking, reset, and security. DFX, partial reconfiguration, is responsible for
> +loading the user compiled FPGA binary.
> +
> +For DFX to work properly, physical partitions require strict HW compatibility
> +with each other. Every physical partition has two interface UUIDs: the *parent*
> +UUID and the *child* UUID. For simple single stage platforms, Shell → User forms
> +the parent child relationship.
> +
> +.. note::
> +   Partition compatibility matching is a key design component of the Alveo platforms
> +   and XRT. Partitions have child and parent relationship. A loaded partition
> +   exposes child partition UUID to advertise its compatibility requirement. When
> +   loading a child partition, the xrt-mgmt driver matches the parent
> +   UUID of the child partition against the child UUID exported by the parent.
> +   The parent and child partition UUIDs are stored in the *xclbin* (for the user)
> +   and the *xsabin* (for the shell). Except for the root UUID exported by VSEC,
> +   the hardware itself does not know about the UUIDs. The UUIDs are stored in
> +   xsabin and xclbin. The image format has a special node called Partition UUIDs
> +   which define the compatibility UUIDs.
> +
> +
> +The physical partitions and their loading are illustrated below::

> +----------------
> +
> +The Shell partition is loaded from flash at system boot time. It establishes the
> +PCIe link and exposes two physical functions to the BIOS. After the OS boots,
> +the xrt-mgmt driver attaches to the PCIe physical function 0 exposed by the Shell
> +and then looks for VSEC in the PCIe extended configuration space. Using VSEC, it
> +determines the logic UUID of the Shell and uses the UUID to load matching *xsabin*
> +file from Linux firmware directory. The xsabin file contains the metadata to
> +discover the peripherals that are part of the Shell and the firmware for any
> +embedded soft processors in the Shell. The xsabin file also contains Partition
> +UUIDs.
> +
> +The Shell exports a child interface UUID which is used for the compatibility
> +check when loading the user compiled xclbin over the User partition as part of DFX.
> +When a user requests loading of a specific xclbin, the xrt-mgmt driver reads
> +the parent interface UUID specified in the xclbin and matches it with the child
> +interface UUID exported by the Shell to determine if the xclbin is compatible with
> +the Shell. If the match fails, loading of xclbin is denied.
> +
> +xclbin loading is requested using the ICAP_DOWNLOAD_AXLF ioctl command. When loading
> +a xclbin, the xrt-mgmt driver performs the following *logical* operations:
> +
> +1. Copy xclbin from user to kernel memory
> +2. Sanity check the xclbin contents
> +3. Isolate the User partition
> +4. Download the bitstream using the FPGA config engine (ICAP)
> +5. De-isolate the User partition
> +6. Program the clocks (ClockWiz) driving the User partition
> +7. Wait for the memory controller (MIG) calibration
> +8. Return the loading status back to the caller

> +xsabin
> +------
> +
> +Each Alveo platform comes packaged with its own xsabin. The xsabin is a trusted
> +component of the platform. For format details refer to :ref:`xsabin_xclbin_container_format`
> +below. xsabin contains basic information like UUIDs, platform name and metadata in the
> +form of device tree. See :ref:`device_tree_usage` below for details and example.
> +
> +xclbin
> +------
> +
> +xclbin is compiled by end user using
> +`Vitis <https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-platform.html>`_
> +tool set from Xilinx. The xclbin contains sections describing user compiled
> +acceleration engines/kernels, memory subsystems, clocking information etc. It also
> +contains an FPGA bitstream for the user partition, UUIDs, platform name, etc.

> +xsabin/xclbin Container Format
> +------------------------------
> +
> +xclbin/xsabin is ELF-like binary container format. It is structured as series of
> +sections. There is a file header followed by several section headers which is
> +followed by sections. A section header points to an actual section. There is an
> +optional signature at the end. The format is defined by the header file ``xclbin.h``.
> +The following figure illustrates a typical xclbin::
