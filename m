 From what I see so far is that this is adapted from downstream qseecom 
driver, this approach could work for a limited usecases but not 
scalable, as we cannot add drivers for each Qualcomm specific TA in kernel.
This has to be handled in much generic way using Linux TEE framework, 
and let the userspace side deal with TA specific bits.

AFAIU, Qualcomm is moving away from qseecom interface to new smc-invoke 
interface, most of Qualcomm SoCs starting from SDM660 already have 
support to this.

This interface provides a better abstracted IPC mechanism to talk to TA. 
Most of these TA specific interfaces are packed in closed userspace source.
Having said that QTEE smcinvoke driver can be modeled as a proper TEE 
driver with Userspace driving the TA specific bits using existing tee uapis.
This also brings in other features like loading, Listeners aka 
callbacks, secure memory allocations..etc.

In the past, I have tried to do a prototype of this smcinvoke driver as 
a proper tee driver, incase you are interested patches are at 
https://git.linaro.org/landing-teams/working/qualcomm/kernel.git/log/?h=tracking-qcomlt-qcomtee
Plan is to discuss with Qualcomm and send it for upstream review.


I think its worth exploring if uefisecapp can talk smcinvoke.
I can ping Qualcomm engineers to see if that is doable.


thanks,
Srini
