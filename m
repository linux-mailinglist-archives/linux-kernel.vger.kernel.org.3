I'd just put into commit message a note like: ext4_mb_normalize_request()
can move logical start of allocated blocks to reduce fragmentation and
better utilize preallocation. However logical block requested as a start of
allocation (ac->ac_o_ex.fe_logical) should always be covered by allocated
blocks so we add assertion to check that.

Cool.
