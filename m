Huh? It's still virtually the same thing; iommu_dma_map_sg() calls 
pci_p2pdma_map_bus_segment(s) and sets s->length to 0 if 
PCI_P2PDMA_MAP_BUS_ADDR, then __finalise_sg() can use 
sg_is_dma_bus_address(s) in place of is_pci_p2pdma_page(sg_page(s)), and 
just propagate the DMA address and original length from s to cur.

Here you've written a patch which looks to correctly interrupt any 
ongoing concatenation state and convey some data from the given input 
segment to the appropriate output segment, so I'm baffled by why you'd 
think you couldn't do what you've already done.

Thanks,
Robin.
