Is there any more specific name of the chip that can be used to identify the
exact generation after a new one comes out? The normal way we handle
compatible strings for devices is to start with a specific model number of
the chip that integrates it, and then have later chips refer to the device by
its new name, with the old one as a fallback. This makes drivers work out of
the box when the device is unchanged, but gives you a way to distinguish them
if a difference gets noticed after both revisions are already used.

As with some of points that Krzysztof and others made previously, the goal
here is to avoid binding incompatibilities in the future: anything that works
in an upstream kernel should keep working in later versions, ideally
allowing any combination of old and new dtb blobs in the bootloader
with old or new kernel versions.

Thanks for the description. This seems quite normal then, similar to the
aspeed and npcm BMC platforms that we support already. You can
probably drop some of the people on the Cc list, but I would suggest you add
the openbmc list and Joel Stanley (Cc'd now) in your next submissions, Joel
would be the best person to review the parts that are BMC specific.
