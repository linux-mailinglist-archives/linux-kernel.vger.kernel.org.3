The problem would become that the MITM firmware has to be evolved in
lockstep with the boot stub.  The problem isn't really a point in time,
figure out what config the boot stub extracts from EFI now and measure
it, it's an ongoing one: given an evolving kernel and UEFI subsystem
means that over time what configuration the kernel extracts from EFI
changes, how do we make sure it's all correctly measured before secure
launch?

If the MITM doesn't support a capability a newer kernel acquires, that
MITM must fail secure launch ... which becomes a nightmare for the
user.

One possibility might be that the MITM actually does nothing at all
except record Boot Service requests and responses up to exit boot
services (EBS).  We could call that record the boot configuration and
measure it, plus we could then intercept EBS, and do the DRTM secure
launch to the return point.  It's conceptually similar Matthew's idea
of a callback except it won't require modification of the boot
parameters.
