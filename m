Hi, Tejun

Here I mean that io is not limited through io throttle from client. Of
course io must be limited by avaliable number of requests.

For example, if we have 8 clients, and available requests is 64.

1) If we don't limit iops, and each client send 64 io to server, some
client might have performance issue.

2) If we limit iops to 8 from clients, then server can receive 64 io at
most at the same time, both client and server should work fine.

3) If we limit iops to 8 for each client from server, client should work
fine, however, server can receive 64 x 8 = 512 io at most at the same
time, which might cause too much pressure on the server.(maybe bps is
more appropriate to explain the high pressure).

Thus I prefer to limit io from client.
