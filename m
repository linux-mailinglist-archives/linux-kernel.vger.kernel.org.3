It really looks safe. klp_check_stack_func() makes sure that @new_func
is not on the stack when klp_target_state == KLP_UNPATCHED. As a
result, the system should not be using code from the livepatch module
when KLP_UNPATCHED transition cleanly finished.

This works only because there is should be only one patch when
klp_target_state == KLP_UNPATCHED and
klp_transition_patch->forced == true.
But it is a bit tricky. I would do it the other way:

	if (klp_transition_patch->replace) {
		klp_for_each_patch(patch)
			patch->forced = true;
	} else if (klp_target_state == KLP_UNPATCHED) {
		klp_transition_patch->forced = true;
	}

It looks more sane. And it makes it more clear
that the special handling of KLP_UNPATCHED transition
is done only when the atomic replace is not used.

Otherwise, I do not see any real problem with the patch.

Best Regards,
Petr
