Each pcie node (all 5 of them) has:

dma-ranges =3D <0x42000000 0x80 0x00 0x80 0x00 0x00 0x80000000
              0x42000000 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x80 0x00>;

I don't know about you, but changing DT is not an acceptable solution
for me. If I'm bisecting something and have to pick the right DT based
on the kernel revision I'm using, that's a huge regression. And I'm
not even mentioning the poor sod who simply updates their distro, only
to find that the box doesn't boot anymore thanks to a kernel upgrade.

We're not talking about a closed embedded device here, but a fully
functional desktop/server box that still run rings around your average
RPi.

I'd be perfectly happy to see both of these go. The last time I used
the kernel DT on my Seattle was some time in 2015, at which point I
got a firmware correctly describing the SMMUs. Oh, and ACPI works just
fine on Seattle.

Well, you can ask Jon. ACPI doesn't work on my box as it doesn't
(properly) describe a console, but my FW is rather old, as explained
in the release notes:

    Version 3.06.25 (10/17/2016)
    Mustang Tianocore (UEFI BIOS) Firmware Features:
     - TianoCore tag linaro-edk2-2014.07 with custom changes

Yes, 2014. Good vintage. But is that the latest and greatest? I have
no idea, and the APM website is long gone.
