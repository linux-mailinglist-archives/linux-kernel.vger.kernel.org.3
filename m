Hi Niklas,

I'm sure this makes good sense, but I need a little more hand-holding.
Sorry this is long and rambling.

I think this would be easier to verify if we kept the explicit error
return, e.g.,

  if (pci_ari_enabled(bus)) {
    if (!dev)
      return -ENODEV;
    pos = pci_find_ext_capability(...);

Otherwise we have to sort through the !dev cases below.  I guess
-ENODEV would come from either the "!fn && !dev" case or the "fn > 6"
case, but it's not obvious to me that those are equivalent to the
previous code.

I don't understand why the "!dev || dev->multifunction" test needs to
change.  Isn't that valid even in the hypervisor case?  IIUC, you want
to return success in some cases that currently return failure, so this
case that was already success should be fine as it was.

Is this because "(fn + 1) % 8" may be zero, which previously
terminated the loop, but now it doesn't because "fn == 0" is the
*first* execution of the loop?

If so, I wonder if we could avoid that case by adding:

  if (fn >= 7)
    return -ENODEV;

at the very beginning.  Maybe that would allow a more trivial patch
that just changed the error return from 0 to -ENODEV, i.e., leaving
all the logic in next_fn() unchanged?

I'm wondering if this could end up like:

    if (fn >= 7)
      return -ENODEV;

    if (pci_ari_enabled(bus)) {
      if (!dev)
	return -ENODEV;
      ...
      return next_fn;
    }

    if (!dev || dev->multifunction)
      return (fn + 1) % 8;

 +  if (hypervisor_isolated_pci_functions())
 +    return (fn + 1) % 8;

    return -ENODEV;

(The hypervisor part being added in a subsequent patch, and I'm not
sure exactly what logic you need there -- the point being that it's
just an additional success case.)

The "% 8" seems possibly superfluous then, since previously that
caused a zero return that terminated the loop.  If we're using -ENODEV
to terminate the loop, we probably don't care about the mod 8.

I understood the original "dev may be NULL ..." comment, but I can't
quite parse this.  "dev can be NULL" for non-zero functions?  That's
basically what it said before, but it's not clear what "otherwise"
refers to.

This part isn't obvious to me yet, partly because of the "!fn && !dev"
construction.  The negatives make it hard to parse.

Since "fn" isn't a boolean or a pointer, I think "fn == 0" is easier
to read than "!fn".  I would test "dev" first since it logically
precedes "fn".

IIUC !dev means we haven't found a function at this device number yet.
So this:

  if (!dev && fn == 0)
    return -ENODEV;

means we called pci_scan_single_device(bus, devfn + 0) the first time
through the loop, and it didn't find a device so it returned NULL.

"devfn + fn" (in the existing, unchanged code) is a little bit weird.
In almost all cases, devfn is the result of "PCI_DEVFN(slot, 0)", so
we could make the interface:

  pci_scan_slot(struct pci_bus *bus, int dev)

where "dev" is 0-31.

The only exceptions are a couple hotplug drivers where the fn probably
is or should be 0, too, but I haven't verified that.

But this would be scope creep, so possibly something we could consider
in the future, but not for this series.
