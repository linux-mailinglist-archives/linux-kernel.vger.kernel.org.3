Pagecache reparenting will probably fix the problem that I have seen. Is 
someone working on this?

As more and more memory are pinned down by dying memcg's, there is just 
less memory available for other useful works. So it is an issue from the 
user point of view. I am not sure how much memory pressure the customers 
have, but they certainly are not happy about that.

I agree that it is a workaround. However, without pagecache reparenting, 
userspace applications may need to be modified to minimize the chance of 
leaving behind dying memcg's. It is not easy either.
