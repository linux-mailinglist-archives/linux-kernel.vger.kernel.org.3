Thanks Steven for spotting this and providing details of the problem.
I have submitted a patch to fix this problem at [1].
But I am facing a small challenge w.r.t __array field type w.r.t perf record
which I have explained in the cover letter.
Would it be possible for you to take a look at it [2] and also at the patch [1].

Thanks a lot for your help!!
