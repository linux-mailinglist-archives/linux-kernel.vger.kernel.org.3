You are right. This scheme treats the system's memory pressure
equally, no matter if it comes from in-kernel page allocation with
high order or cache drop by IO like things. The decay_factor composed
of PSI_SOME and PSI_FULL which represent the system is tight on
memory, every entity has the obligation to donate to solve this issue.

Yes. As my reply to Suren's comment, even a positive monitor service
which could be aware of the activity starting(APP launching etc) at
the very first time, has to 1. read PSI and memcg->watermark/usage 2.
make a decision. 3. write memcg->memory.low to adjust memory
allowance. Furthermore, monitors could not supervise the APP for whole
life time, while the reclaiming could arise at any time.
