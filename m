Ok, so this creation would potentially be done on request from some PCI
driver that want to apply it's overlay on the tree. Should I actually
add some function such as of_pci_apply_overlay() which would create the
PCI node tree if not present and apply the overlay to the of_node that
is associated to the PCIe device ?

Not sure either but that's better not to play with that.

Ok, so this will be done as a first separate series to add property
creation then.

Ok, wasn't aware of that. If I understand, I'll need to obtain the
range of PCI addresses that are behind the bridge to fill in this
ranges property right ?

Ok.
