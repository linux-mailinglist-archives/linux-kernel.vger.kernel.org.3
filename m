With this part removed, I'm missing how you handle the following
sequence of events:
1.  a queue Q becomes non busy but still has dispatched requests, so
it must not be removed from the counter of queues with pending reqs
yet
2.  the last request of Q is completed with Q being still idle (non
busy).  At this point Q must be removed from the counter.  It seems to
me that this case is not handled any longer

Additional comment: if your changes do not cpus the problem above,
then this function only invokes __bfq_weights_tree_remove.  So what's
the point in keeping this function)

I would really love it if you leave this comment.  I added it after
suffering a lot for a nasty UAF.  Of course the first sentence may
need to be adjusted if the code that precedes it is to be removed.

Thanks,
Paolo
