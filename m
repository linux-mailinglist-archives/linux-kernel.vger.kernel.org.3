I'm guessing bcache used did some optimization for 
queue->limits.raid_partial_stripes_expensive because md raid5 code sets 
this flag.  At least when using Linux md as the RAID5 implementation it 
gets configured automatically:
   raid5.c:       mddev->queue->limits.raid_partial_stripes_expensive = 1;

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/md/raid5.c#L7729

Interestingly only bcache uses it, but md does set it.

Maybe any time io_opt is provided then partial_stripes_expensive should be 
flagged too and any code to the contrary should be removed?

Question: Does anyone have a reason to keep partial_stripes_expensive in 
the kernel at all?

Agreed, thanks for the feedback!
