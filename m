Could you please describe it in more details?
Maybe it was passed me by, maybe I messed or forgot something,
however I cannot remember any other practical cgroup-related issues.

Maybe deep hierarchies does not work well.
however, I have not heard that the internal configuration of cgroup
can affect the upper level too.

Please let me know if this can happen, this is very interesting for us.

In our case, the hoster configures only the top level of the cgroup
and does not worry about possible misconfiguration inside containers
if it does not affect other containers or the host itself.

Unaccounted memory, contrary, can affects both neighbor containers and host system,
we saw it many times, and therefore we pay special attention to such issues.

Thank you,
