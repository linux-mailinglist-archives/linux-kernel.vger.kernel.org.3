There is no Acked-by tag on the latest version you posted:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220210144745.135721-1-manivannan.sadhasivam@linaro.org

it looks like the tags were given after v2 was posted, hence the
confusion.

I will apply the tags myself this time but what matters for me
is always the latest version posted, I archive the previous ones.
