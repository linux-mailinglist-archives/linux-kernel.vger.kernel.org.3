We already do that with some more metrics
pgrefill 9801926
pgscan 27329762
pgsteal 22715987
pgactivate 250691267
pgdeactivate 9521843

How precise this information should be? A very simplistic approach would
be
cp memory.stat stats.before
echo $WHATEVER > memory.reclaim
cp memory.stat stats.after

This will obviously contain also activity outside of the explicitly
triggered reclaim (racing background/direct reclaim) but isn't that what
actually matters? Are there any cases where the only metric you care
about is the triggered reclaim in isolation?
