Ah, right. That's something I want to fix because lots of drivers have
2 sets of accessors for this reason.

Shouldn't you be setting PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS and/or PCI_EXP_LNKCAP2 if
you need to limit the max speed and then you can use that instead of
max-link-speed? If that's lost in low power modes, the driver just has
to save and restore it.

All this link handling is also something we want to make common as
much as possible. There's a lot of drivers poking these registers in
different ways and it's not clear whether they really need to be
different. So the less you do in the kernel the better.
