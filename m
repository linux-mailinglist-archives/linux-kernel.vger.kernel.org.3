Looking at Will's series that introduced user_cpus_ptr, I think we can 
overlay our proposal on top of that. So calling sched_setaffinity() will 
also update user_cpus_ptr. We may still need a flag to indicate whether 
user_cpus_ptr is set up because of sched_setaffinity() or due to a call 
to force_compatible_cpus_allowed_ptr() from arm64 arch code. That will 
make our work easier as some of the infrastructure is already there. I 
am looking forward for your feedback.

Thanks,
Longman
