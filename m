Hi Vidya,

For me (on Apollolake devices) the results remain the same, but as
I've mentioned earlier - it looks very much related exactly to the
Apollolake and is not directly related to your patch (e.g. I'm losing
L1SS capabilities even without your patch).
As a counter example, I don't  observe any issues with your patach
(v3) on Amberlake devices - lspci -vvv before suspend and after resume
are exactly the same.

Best regards,
Lukasz
