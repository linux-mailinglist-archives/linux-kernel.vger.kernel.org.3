This is popular and bad at the same time. We as the mainline kernel 
developer cannot guarantee that this works as expected. A lot of issues 
are caused by mixing vendor DTS with mainline kernel, so in general (not 
for this specific issue) you are on your own with this approach.

I know this is a little bit off topic but except from overlay support, 
can you provide a list of most missing features of the mainline kernel / 
DTS?

At least it would increase the chance to be accepted. This rounding 
behavior looks open coded, maybe there is already a function to achieve 
this.
