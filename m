The sad reality is that mem=3D is known to be used in production for
limiting the amount of memory that the kernel takes control of, in
order to allow the remainder to be used in platform specific ways.

Of course, there are much better ways to achieve that, but given that
we currently support it, I don't think we can easily back that out.

I do think that there is no need to go out of our way to make this
case work seamlessly with mirrored memory, though. So I'd prefer to
make the remove+re-add conditional on there actually being a need to
do so. That way, we don't break the old use case or mirrored memory,
and whatever happens when the two are combined is DONTCARE.
