Interesting use case.  Can you share any example livepatches where the
transition time was exceptionally long and that lead to requiring this
patch?

From a kpatch developer's perspective, it would be interesting to read
how you go about ensuring forced livepatch safety.  We don't generally
build forced livepatches, so I'm curious how the dev/review process goes.
