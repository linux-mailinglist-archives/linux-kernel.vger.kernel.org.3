Unfortunately, there is still no difference. Even worse, I thought I
might be able to get some information from the emergency shell but I
don't think the HID driver is loaded yet so my keyboard does not work. I
am not sure of how to get any further information from the problematic
kernel; if anyone has any ideas, I am happy to test them! I am more than
happy to continue to test patches or provide information, I just don't
want to be a waste of time :)
