Hi, Paolo

For example, we only issue io in child group c2(root->c1->c2),
'num_groups_with_pending_reqs' will end up greater than 1, thus it's
impossible to handle sync io concurrently. Thus I don't count root and
c1, only count c2.

Yes, if c1, c2 are both active, and then c1 don't have any pending reqs,
I want to decrease num_groups_with_pending_reqs to 1 immediately. So
that sync io on c2 can be handled concurrently.

Kuai
