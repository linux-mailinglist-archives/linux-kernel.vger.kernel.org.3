Yes, on commit-done path we zero out jh->b_transaction (or set
jh->b_transaction = jh->b_next_transaction; jh->b_next_transaction = NULL).
So these fields are actually guaranteed to be zero on free.

No problem. Thanks for reverting the patch. I can imagine that jbd2's use
of SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU is an unusual one...
