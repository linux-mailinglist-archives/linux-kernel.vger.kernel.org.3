OK, so if *jh was freed and re-zallocated in the meantime, this test
should fail.  One concern would be if the zeroing was not at least eight
bytes at a time, maybe due to overly eager use of fancy SIMD hardware.
Though perhaps you also do something about ->b_committed_data on
the free path, the commit-done path, or whatever?  (I do see a
"jh->b_committed_data = NULL" on what might well be the commit-done path.)

And same with these guys.

Regardless of whether you are suffering a lack of imagination, you
have clearly demonstrated that it is possible to correctly use the
SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU flag in conjunction with kmem_cache_alloc(), thus
demonstrating that I was suffering from a lack of imagination.  ;-)

I have therefore reverted my commit.  Please accept my apologies for
the hassle!

							Thanx, Paul
