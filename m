What clean up are you implying here? Those legacy platform might need
OMAP_GPMC for booting so they select it. There is nothing much we can do there.

What is left to do now is make user/defconfig files to enable OMAP_GPMC driver
so other platforms that don't need OMAP_GPMC for basic operation can still
enable them later via defconfig or manually by user.
