Hi Frank,

This work uses the kernel space interface (of_overlay_fdt_apply())
and the device tree overlay is builtin the driver. This interface was
used until recently by rcu-dcar driver. While the only user (sic),
this seems to work pretty well and I was able to use it successfully.

Moreover, this support targets at using this with PCI devices. This
devices are really well contained and do not interfere with other
devices. This actually consists in adding a complete subtree into the
existing device-tree and thus it limits the interactions between
potentially platform provided devices and PCI ones.
