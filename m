Firstly I got rejection of my other patches because they does not handle
SDP_CUST correctly. So I decided to look at those issues and fix it via
helper function which can be easily reused in all drivers. So helper
function wrap all "ugly" hacks. Then I got reaction that SDP should be
removed. Then I got another reaction that that "I'm not saying to remove
them" and another another reaction why to be removed eventually.

So how should I interpret this? I'm feeling that you are just trying to
annoy people with this "do this", "do opposite", "do again it", "do
again opposite"...

Argh... Have you read emails to which you wrote reply? So copy+paste
relevant part from my previous email just for you:

 "New version of tcsetattr and ioctl_tty manpages would have documented
  how to use BOTHER (it is currently in the manpages git)."

Plus in past I also pointed to the extended version of that example from
manpage which is currently in my repo on github:

Because it is unusable? API which standard linux userspace applications
cannot use is useless. And for application develop it does not matter if
issue is in kernel part of API or userspace part of API. At the end
would be use used.

With whole this discussion I have feeling that there correct way is just
to use SDP flags in userspace as there is no interest in fixing BOTHER's
c_ospeed and c_ispeed in kernel drivers and it was rejected just because
of not handling SDP flags correctly.
