Hi Paul,

Thanks for offering to test!  I don't see the F2A85-M PRO listed in the 
asus_wmi_boards array, so (unless there's some alternate model name it 
also goes by that's in that list) I don't think it will provide coverage 
for the asuswmi code, but additional testing of the platform driver 
would still be good anyway.

To try it out, first apply the patch series on top of Guenter's current 
hwmon-next tree (it's based on commit 5d4a2ea96b79).  You'll need to 
enable both the existing CONFIG_SENSORS_NCT6775 Kconfig option as well 
as the new CONFIG_SENSORS_NCT6775_PLATFORM.  Then compile, install, and 
boot into the resulting kernel.  If you set 
CONFIG_SENSORS_NCT6775_PLATFORM=m (compiling it as a module) you'll need 
to run 'modprobe nct6775-platform' to load the module, after which 
running 'sensors' from the lm-sensors package should show sensor 
readings from it -- if things are working right, it should behave pretty 
much exactly as the driver did prior to these patches.

However, since posting the v2 patch series I realized I bungled 
something in the regmap conversion (patch 2 of the series), so before 
compiling you should also apply this small fixup (which will be included 
in subsequent versions of the patchset):

diff --git a/drivers/hwmon/nct6775-core.c b/drivers/hwmon/nct6775-core.c

Thanks,
