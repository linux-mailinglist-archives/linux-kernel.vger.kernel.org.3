and tracking both for users and developers. Among others describe the
first rule of Linux kernel development and what it means in practice.
Also explain what a regression actually is and how to report one
properly. The text additionally provides a brief introduction to the bot
the kernel's regression tracker uses to facilitate his work. To sum
things up, provide a few quotes from Linus to show how serious he takes
regressions.

+Regressions
++++++++++++
+
+The first rule of Linux kernel development: '*We don't cause regressions*'.
+Linux founder and lead developer Linus Torvalds strictly enforces the rule
+himself. This document describes what this means in practice and how the Linux
+kernel's development model ensures all reported regressions are addressed; it
+covers aspects relevant for both users and developers.
+
+The important bits for people affected by regressions
+=====================================================
+
+It's a regression if something running fine with one Linux kernel works worse or
+not at all with a newer version. Note, the newer kernel has to be compiled using
+a similar configuration -- for this and other fine print, check out below
+section "What is a 'regression' and what is the 'no regressions rule'?".
+
+Report your regression as outlined in
+`Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-issues.rst`, it already covers all aspects
+important for regressions. Below section "How do I report a regression?"
+highlights them for convenience.
+
+The most important aspect: CC or forward the report to `the regression mailing
+list <https://lore.kernel.org/regressions/>`_ (regressions@lists.linux.dev).
+When doing so, consider mentioning the version range where the regression
+started using a paragraph like this::
+
+       #regzbot introduced v5.13..v5.14-rc1
+
+The Linux kernel regression tracking bot 'regzbot' will then add the report to
+the list of tracked regressions. This is in your interest, as it brings the
+report on the radar of people ensuring all regressions are acted upon in a
+timely manner.
+
+The important bits for people fixing regressions
+================================================
+
+When receiving regression reports by mail, check if the reporter CCed `the
+regression mailing list <https://lore.kernel.org/regressions/>`_
+(regressions@lists.linux.dev). If not, forward or bounce the report to the Linux
+kernel's regression tracker (regressions@leemhuis.info), unless you plan on
+sending a reply to the report anyway. In that case simply CC the list in a
+direct reply to the report. Also check, if the report included a 'regzbot
+command' like ``#regzbot introduced v5.13..v5.14-rc1`` (see above); if not,
+please include a paragraph like the following, as the Linux kernel regression
+tracking bot 'regzbot' will then immediately start tracking the regression::
+
+       #regzbot ^introduced v5.13..v5.14-rc1
+
+If the report was filed in a public bug tracker, forward it to the regression
+list; add the aforementioned paragraph, just omit the caret (the ^) before the
+``introduced``, which makes regzbot treat your mail (and not the one you reply
+to) as the report.
+
+When submitting fixes for regressions, always include 'Link:' tags in the commit
+message that point to all places where the issue was reported, as explained in
+`Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst` and
+:ref:`Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst <development_posting>`. Hence, link to
+any mails in the archive with reports about the issue as well as all bug tracker
+entries::
+
+       Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/30th.anniversary.repost@klaava.Helsinki.FI/
+       Link: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215375
+
+This is important for regression tracking, as this allows regzbot to
+automatically associate tracked regression reports with patch postings and
+commits fixing it.
+
+
+All the details on handling Linux kernel regressions
+====================================================
+
+The important basics
+--------------------
+
+What is a 'regression' and what is the 'no regressions rule'?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It's a regression if some application or practical use case running fine on one
+Linux kernel works worse or not at all with a newer version compiled using a
+similar configuration. The 'no regressions rule' forbids this to happen. If a
+regression happens by accident, developers that caused it are expected to
+quickly fix the issue.
+
+It thus is a regression when a WiFi driver from Linux 5.13 works fine, but with
+5.14 doesn't work at all, works significantly slower, or misbehaves somehow.
+It's also a regression if a perfectly working application suddenly shows erratic
+behavior with a newer kernel version, which can be caused by changes in procfs,
+sysfs, or one of the many other interfaces Linux provides to userland software.
+But keep in mind, as mentioned earlier: 5.14 in this example needs to be built
+from a configuration similar to the one from 5.13. This can be achieved using
+``make olddefconfig``, as explained in more detail below.
+
+Note the 'practical use case' in the first sentence of this section: developers
+despite the 'no regressions' rule are free to change any aspect of the kernel
+and even APIs or ABIs to userland, as long as no existing application or use
+case breaks.
+
+Also be aware the 'no regressions' rule covers only interfaces the kernel
+provides to the userland. It thus does not apply to kernel-internal interfaces
+like the module API, which some externally developed drivers use to hook into
+the kernel.
+
+What is the goal of the 'no regressions rule'?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Users should feel safe when updating kernel versions and not have to worry
+something might break. This is in the interest of the kernel developers to make
+updating attractive: they don't want users to stay on stable or longterm Linux
+series either abandoned or more than one and a half year old, as `those might
+have known problems, security issues, or other aspects already improved in later
+versions <http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2018/08/24/what-stable-kernel-should-i-use/>`_.
+The kernel developers also want to make it simple and appealing for users to
+test the latest pre-release or regular release, as it's a lot easier to track
+down and fix problems, if they are reported shortly after being introduced.
+
+
+How hard is the rule enforced?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Extraordinarily strict, as can be seen by many mailing list posts from Linux
+creator and lead developer Linus Torvalds, some of which are quoted at the end
+of this document.
+
+Exceptions to this rule are extremely rare; in the past developers almost always
+turned out to be wrong when they assumed a particular situation was warranting
+an exception.
+
+How is the rule enforced?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It's the duty of the subsystem maintainers, which are watched and supported by
+Linus Torvalds for mainline or stable/longterm tree maintainers like Greg
+Kroah-Hartman. All of them are supported by Thorsten Leemhuis: he's acting as
+'regressions tracker' for the Linux kernel and trying to ensure all regression
+reports are acted upon in a timely manner.
+
+The distributed and slightly unstructured nature of the Linux kernel's
+development makes tracking regressions hard. That's why Thorsten relies on the
+help of his Linux kernel regression tracking robot 'regzbot'. It watches mailing
+lists and git trees to semi-automatically associate regression reports to patch
+submissions and commits fixing the issue, as this provides all necessary
+insights into the fixing progress.
+
+Note, the regression tracker can only ensure no regression falls through the
+cracks, if someone tells him or his bot about every regression found. That's why
+the report needs to be sent to the regressions mailing list (ideally with a
+'regzbot command' in the mail), as explained in the next section.
+
+How do I report a regression?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Just report the issue as outlined in
+`Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-issues.rst`, it already describes the
+important points. The following aspects described there are especially relevant
+for regressions:
+
+ * When checking for existing reports to join, first check the `archives of the
+   Linux regressions mailing list <https://lore.kernel.org/regressions/>`_ and
+   `regzbot's web-interface <https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/>`_.
+
+ * In your report, mention the last kernel version that worked fine and the
+   first broken one. Even better: try to find the commit causing the regression
+   using a bisection.
+
+ * Remember to let the Linux regressions mailing list
+   (regressions@lists.linux.dev) known about your report:
+
+  * If you report the regression by mail, CC the regressions list.
+
+  * If you report your regression to some bug tracker, forward the filed report
+    by mail to the regressions list while CCing the maintainer and the mailing
+    list for the subsystem in question.
+
+Additionally, you in both cases should directly tell the aforementioned Linux
+kernel regression tracking bot about your report. To do that, include a
+paragraph like this in your report to tell the bot when the regression started
+to happen::
+
+       #regzbot introduced: v5.13..v5.14-rc1
+
+In this example, v5.13 was the last version that worked, while v5.14-rc1 was the
+first broken one. The smaller the range, the better, as that makes it easier to
+find out what's wrong and who's responsible. That's why you ideally should
+perform a bisection to find the commit causing the regression (the 'culprit').
+If you did, specify it instead::
+
+       #regzbot introduced: 1f2e3d4c5d
+
+Placing such a 'regzbot command' is in your interest, as it will ensure the
+report won't fall through the cracks unnoticed. If you omit this, the Linux
+kernel's regressions tracker will take care of telling regzbot about your
+regression, as long as you send a copy to the regressions mailing lists. But the
+regression tracker is just one human which sometimes has to rest or occasionally
+might even enjoy some time away from computers (as crazy as that might sound).
+Relying on this person thus will result in an unnecessary delay before the
+regressions becomes mentioned `on the list of tracked and unresolved Linux
+kernel regressions <https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/>`_ and the
+weekly regression reports sent by regzbot. Such delays can result in Linus
+Torvalds being unaware of important regressions when deciding between 'continue
+development or call this finished by performing a release?'.
+
+How to add a regression to regzbot's tracking somebody else reported?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Use your mailers 'Reply-all' function to send a reply where you CC the
+regressions list (regressions@lists.linux.dev). In that reply create a new
+paragraph with a regzbot command like this::
+
+       #regzbot ^introduced: v5.13..v5.14-rc1
+
+The caret (^) before the 'introduced' makes regzbot treat the parent mail (the
+one you reply to) as the report for the regression you want to see tracked.
+Instead of a version range you can also specify the commit causing the
+regression, as outlined in the previous section.
+
+If the report came in private from a bug tracker, forward it to the list;
+include the aforementioned line, just omit the caret (the ^) before the
+'introduced'; consider adding a line with the line '#regzbot link: <url>' (see
+below) pointing to the place with the initial report.
+
+Alternatively to all the above you can just forward or bounce the report to the
+Linux kernel's regression tracker, but consider the downsides already outlined
+in the previous section.
+
+Are really all regressions fixed?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Nearly all of them are, as long as the change causing the regression (the
+'culprit commit') is reliably identified. Some regressions can be fixed without
+this, but often it's required.
+
+Who needs to find the commit causing a regression?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It's the reporter's duty to find the culprit, but developers of the affected
+subsystem should offer advice and reasonably help where they can.
+
+How can I find the change causing a regression?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Perform a bisection, as roughly outlined in `Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-issues.rst`
+and described in more detail by `Documentation/admin-guide/bug-bisect.rst`.
+It might sound like a lot of work, but in many cases finds the culprit
+relatively quickly. If it's hard or time-consuming to reliably reproduce the
+issue, consider teaming up with others affected by the problem to narrow down
+the search range together.
+
+Who can I ask for advice when it comes to regressions?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Send a mail to the regressions mailing list (regressions@lists.linux.dev) while
+CCing the Linux kernel's regression tracker (regressions@leemhuis.info); if the
+issue might better be dealt with in private, feel free to omit the list.
+
+
+More details about regressions relevant for reporters
+-----------------------------------------------------
+
+Does a regression need to be fixed, if it can be avoided by updating some other software?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Almost always: yes. If a developer tells you otherwise, ask the regression
+tracker for advice as outlined above.
+
+Does it qualify as a regression if a newer kernel works slower or makes the system consume more energy?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It does, but the difference has to be significant. A five percent slow-down in a
+micro-benchmark thus is unlikely to qualify as regression, unless it also
+influences the results of a broad benchmark by more than one percent. If in
+doubt, ask for advice.
+
+Is it a regression, if an externally developed kernel module is incompatible with a newer kernel?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+No, as the 'no regression' rule is about interfaces and services the Linux
+kernel provides to the userland. It thus does not cover building or running
+externally developed kernel modules, as they run in kernel-space and use
+occasionally changed internal interfaces to hook into the kernel.
+
+How are regressions handled that are caused by a fix for security vulnerability?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+In extremely rare situations security issues can't be fixed without causing
+regressions; those are given way, as they are the lesser evil in the end.
+Luckily this almost always can be avoided, as key developers for the affected
+area and often Linus Torvalds himself try very hard to fix security issues
+without causing regressions.
+
+If you nevertheless face such a case, check the mailing list archives if people
+tried their best to avoid the regression; if in doubt, ask for advice as
+outlined above.
+
+What happens if fixing a regression is impossible without causing another regression?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Sadly these things happen, but luckily not very often; if they occur, expert
+developers of the affected code area should look into the issue to find a fix
+that avoids regressions or at least their impact. If you run into such a
+situation you thus do what was outlined already for regressions caused by
+security fixes: check earlier discussions if people already tried their best and
+ask for advice if in doubt.
+
+A quick note while at it: these situations could be avoided, if you would
+regularly give mainline pre-releases (say v5.15-rc1 or -rc3) from each cycle a
+test run. This is best explained by imagining a change integrated between Linux
+v5.14 and v5.15-rc1 which causes a regression, but at the same time is a hard
+requirement for some other improvement applied for 5.15-rc1. All these changes
+often can simply be reverted and the regression thus solved, if someone finds
+and reports it before 5.15 is released. A few days or weeks later after the
+release this solution might become impossible, if some software starts to rely
+on aspects introduced by one of the follow-up changes: reverting all changes
+would cause regressions for users of said software and thus out of the question.
+
+A feature I relied on was removed months ago, but I only noticed now. Does that qualify as regression?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It does, but often it's hard to fix them due to the aspects outlined in the
+previous section. It hence needs to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis; this
+is another reason why it's in your interest to regularly test mainline releases.
+
+Does the 'no regression' rule apply if I seem to be the only person in the world that is affected by a regression?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It does, but only for practical usage: the Linux developers want to be free to
+remove support for hardware only to be found in attics and museums anymore.
+
+Note, sometimes regressions can't be avoided to make progress -- and the latter
+is needed to prevent Linux from stagnation. Hence, if only very few users seem
+to be affected by a regression, it for the greater good might be in their and
+everyone else's interest to not insist on the rule. Especially if there is an
+easy way to circumvent the regression somehow, for example by updating some
+software or using a kernel parameter created just for this purpose.
+
+Does the regression rule apply for code in the staging tree as well?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Not according to the `help text for the configuration option covering all
+staging code <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/staging/Kconfig>`_,
+which since its early days states::
+
+       Please note that these drivers are under heavy development, may or
+       may not work, and may contain userspace interfaces that most likely
+       will be changed in the near future.
+
+The staging developers nevertheless often adhere to the 'no regressions' rule,
+but sometimes bend it to make progress. That's for example why some users had to
+deal with (often negligible) regressions when a WiFi driver from the staging
+tree was replaced by a totally different one written from scratch.
+
+Why do later versions have to be 'compiled with a similar configuration'?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Because the Linux kernel developers sometimes integrate changes known to cause
+regressions, but make them optional and disable them in the kernel's default
+configuration. This trick allows progress, as the 'no regressions' rule
+otherwise would lead to stagnation. Consider for example a new security feature
+which blocks access to some kernel interfaces often abused by malware, but at
+the same time are required to run a few rarely used applications. The outlined
+trick makes both camps happy: people using these applications can leave the new
+security feature off, while everyone else can enable it without running into
+trouble.
+
+How to create a configuration similar to the one of an older kernel?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Start a known-good kernel and configure the newer Linux version with ``make
+olddefconfig``. This makes the kernel's build scripts pick up the configuration
+file (the `.config` file) from the running kernel as base for the new one you
+are about to compile; afterwards they set all new configuration options to their
+default value, which disables new features that might cause regressions.
+
+Can I report a regression with vanilla kernels provided by someone else to the upstream Linux kernel developers?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Only if the newer kernel was compiled with a similar configuration file as the
+older one (see above), as your provider might have enabled some known-to-be
+incompatible feature in the newer kernel. If in a doubt, report this problem to
+the provider and ask for advice.
+
+
+More details about regressions relevant for developers
+------------------------------------------------------
+
+What should I do, if I suspect a change I'm working on might cause regressions?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Evaluate how big the risk of regressions is, for example by performing a code
+search in Linux distributions and Git forges. Also consider asking other
+developers or projects likely to be affected to evaluate or even test the
+proposed change; if problems surface, maybe some middle ground acceptable for
+all can be found.
+
+If the risk of regressions in the end seems to be relatively small, go ahead
+with the change, but let all involved parties know about the risk. Hence, make
+sure your patch description makes this aspect obvious. Once the change is
+merged, tell the Linux kernel's regression tracker and the regressions mailing
+list about the risk, so everyone has the change on the radar in case reports
+trickle in. Depending on the risk, you also might want to ask the subsystem
+maintainer to mention the issue in his mainline pull request.
+
+
+Everything developers need to know about regression tracking
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Do I have to use regzbot?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It's in the interest of everyone if you do, as kernel maintainers like Linus
+Torvalds partly rely on regzbot's tracking in their work -- for example when
+deciding to release a new version or extend the development phase. For this they
+need to be aware of all unfixed regression; to do that, Linus is known to look
+into the weekly reports sent by regzbot.
+
+Do I have to tell regzbot about every regression I stumble upon?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Ideally yes: we are all humans and easily forget problems when something more
+important unexpectedly comes up -- for example a bigger problem in the Linux
+kernel or something in real life that's keeping us away from keyboards for a
+while. Hence, it's best to tell regzbot about every regression, except when you
+immediately write a fix and commit it to a tree regularly merged to the affected
+kernel series.
+
+Why does the Linux kernel need a regression tracker, and why does he utilize regzbot?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Rules like 'no regressions' need someone to enforce them, otherwise they are
+broken either accidentally or on purpose. History has shown that this is true
+for the Linux kernel as well. That's why Thorsten volunteered to keep an eye on
+things.
+
+Tracking regressions completely manually has proven to be exhausting and
+demotivating, which is why earlier attempts to establish it failed after a
+while. To prevent this from happening again, Thorsten developed Regzbot to
+facilitate the work, with the long term goal to automate regression tracking as
+much as possible for everyone involved.
+
+How does regression tracking work with regzbot?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The bot keeps track of all the reports and monitors their fixing progress. It
+tries to do that with as little overhead as possible for both reporters and
+developers.
+
+In fact, only reporters or someone helping them are burdened with an extra duty:
+they need to tell regzbot about the regression report using one of the
+``#regzbot introduced`` commands outlined above.
+
+For developers there normally is no extra work involved, they just need to do
+something that's expected from them already: add 'Link:' tags to the patch
+description pointing to all reports about the issue fixed.
+
+Thanks to these tags regzbot can associate regression reports with patches to
+fix the issue, whenever they are posted for review or applied to a git tree. The
+bot additionally watches out for replies to the report. All this data combined
+provides a good impression about the current status of the fixing process.
+
+How to see which regressions regzbot tracks currently?

+for the latest info; alternatively, `search for the latest regression report
+<https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/?q=%22Linux+regressions+report%22+f%3Aregzbot>`_,
+which regzbot normally sends out once a week on Sunday evening (UTC), which is a
+few hours before Linus usually publishes new (pre-)releases.
+
+What places is regzbot monitoring?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Regzbot is watching the most important Linux mailing lists as well as the
+linux-next, mainline and stable/longterm git repositories.
+
+How to interact with regzbot?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Everyone can interact with the bot using mails containing `regzbot commands`,
+which need to be in their own paragraph (IOW: they need to be separated from the
+rest of the mail using blank lines). One such command is ``#regzbot introduced
+<version or commit>``, which adds a report to the tracking, as already described
+above; ``#regzbot ^introduced <version or commit>`` is another such command,
+which makes regzbot consider the parent mail as a report for a regression which
+it starts to track.
+
+Once one of those two commands has been utilized, other regzbot commands can be
+used. You can write them below one of the `introduced` commands or in replies to
+the mail that used one of them or itself is a reply to that mail:
+
+ * Set or update the title::
+
+       #regzbot title: foo
+
+ * Link to a related discussion (for example the posting of a patch to fix the
+   issue) and monitor it::
+
+       #regzbot monitor: https://lore.kernel.org/all/30th.anniversary.repost@klaava.Helsinki.FI/
+
+   Monitoring only works for lore.kernel.org; regzbot will consider all messages
+   in that thread as related to the fixing process.
+
+ * Point to a place with further details, like a bug tracker or a related
+   mailing list post::
+
+       #regzbot link: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123456789
+
+ * Mark a regression as fixed by a commit that is heading upstream or already
+   landed::
+
+       #regzbot fixed-by: 1f2e3d4c5d
+
+ * Mark a regression as a duplicate of another one already tracked by regzbot::
+
+       #regzbot dup-of: https://lore.kernel.org/all/30th.anniversary.repost@klaava.Helsinki.FI/
+
+ * Mark a regression as invalid::
+
+       #regzbot invalid: wasn't a regression, problem has always existed
+
+Is there more to tell about regzbot and its commands?
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+More detailed and up-to-date information about the Linux kernels regression
+tracking bot can be found on its `project page <https://gitlab.com/knurd42/regzbot>`_,
+which among others contains a  `getting started guide <https://gitlab.com/knurd42/regzbot/-/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md>`_

+Quotes from Linus about regression
+----------------------------------
+
+Find below a few real life examples of how Linus Torvalds expects regressions to
+be handled:
+
+ * From `2017-10-26 (1/2)
+   <https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CA+55aFwiiQYJ+YoLKCXjN_beDVfu38mg=Ggg5LFOcqHE8Qi7Zw@mail.gmail.com/>`_::
+
+       If you break existing user space setups THAT IS A REGRESSION.
+
+       It's not ok to say "but we'll fix the user space setup".
+
+       Really. NOT OK.
+
+       [...]
+
+       The first rule is:
+
+        - we don't cause regressions
+
+       and the corollary is that when regressions *do* occur, we admit to
+       them and fix them, instead of blaming user space.
+
+       The fact that you have apparently been denying the regression now for
+       three weeks means that I will revert, and I will stop pulling apparmor
+       requests until the people involved understand how kernel development
+       is done.
+
+ * From `2017-10-26 (2/2)
+   <https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CA+55aFxW7NMAMvYhkvz1UPbUTUJewRt6Yb51QAx5RtrWOwjebg@mail.gmail.com/>`_::
+
+       People should basically always feel like they can update their kernel
+       and simply not have to worry about it.
+
+       I refuse to introduce "you can only update the kernel if you also
+       update that other program" kind of limitations. If the kernel used to
+       work for you, the rule is that it continues to work for you.
+
+       There have been exceptions, but they are few and far between, and they
+       generally have some major and fundamental reasons for having happened,
+       that were basically entirely unavoidable, and people _tried_hard_ to
+       avoid them. Maybe we can't practically support the hardware any more
+       after it is decades old and nobody uses it with modern kernels any
+       more. Maybe there's a serious security issue with how we did things,
+       and people actually depended on that fundamentally broken model. Maybe
+       there was some fundamental other breakage that just _had_ to have a
+       flag day for very core and fundamental reasons.
+
+       And notice that this is very much about *breaking* peoples environments.
+
+       Behavioral changes happen, and maybe we don't even support some
+       feature any more. There's a number of fields in /proc/<pid>/stat that
+       are printed out as zeroes, simply because they don't even *exist* in
+       the kernel any more, or because showing them was a mistake (typically
+       an information leak). But the numbers got replaced by zeroes, so that
+       the code that used to parse the fields still works. The user might not
+       see everything they used to see, and so behavior is clearly different,
+       but things still _work_, even if they might no longer show sensitive
+       (or no longer relevant) information.
+
+       But if something actually breaks, then the change must get fixed or
+       reverted. And it gets fixed in the *kernel*. Not by saying "well, fix
+       your user space then". It was a kernel change that exposed the
+       problem, it needs to be the kernel that corrects for it, because we
+       have a "upgrade in place" model. We don't have a "upgrade with new
+       user space".
+
+       And I seriously will refuse to take code from people who do not
+       understand and honor this very simple rule.
+
+       This rule is also not going to change.
+
+       And yes, I realize that the kernel is "special" in this respect. I'm
+       proud of it.
+
+       I have seen, and can point to, lots of projects that go "We need to
+       break that use case in order to make progress" or "you relied on
+       undocumented behavior, it sucks to be you" or "there's a better way to
+       do what you want to do, and you have to change to that new better
+       way", and I simply don't think that's acceptable outside of very early
+       alpha releases that have experimental users that know what they signed
+       up for. The kernel hasn't been in that situation for the last two
+       decades.
+
+       We do API breakage _inside_ the kernel all the time. We will fix
+       internal problems by saying "you now need to do XYZ", but then it's
+       about internal kernel API's, and the people who do that then also
+       obviously have to fix up all the in-kernel users of that API. Nobody
+       can say "I now broke the API you used, and now _you_ need to fix it
+       up". Whoever broke something gets to fix it too.
+
+       And we simply do not break user space.
+
+ * From `2020-05-21
+   <https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAHk-=wiVi7mSrsMP=fLXQrXK_UimybW=ziLOwSzFTtoXUacWVQ@mail.gmail.com/>`_::
+
+       The rules about regressions have never been about any kind of
+       documented behavior, or where the code lives.
+
+       The rules about regressions are always about "breaks user workflow".
+
+       Users are literally the _only_ thing that matters.
+
+       No amount of "you shouldn't have used this" or "that behavior was
+       undefined, it's your own fault your app broke" or "that used to work
+       simply because of a kernel bug" is at all relevant.
+
+       Now, reality is never entirely black-and-white. So we've had things
+       like "serious security issue" etc that just forces us to make changes
+       that may break user space. But even then the rule is that we don't
+       really have other options that would allow things to continue.
+
+       And obviously, if users take years to even notice that something
+       broke, or if we have sane ways to work around the breakage that
+       doesn't make for too much trouble for users (ie "ok, there are a
+       handful of users, and they can use a kernel command line to work
+       around it" kind of things) we've also been a bit less strict.
+
+       But no, "that was documented to be broken" (whether it's because the
+       code was in staging or because the man-page said something else) is
+       irrelevant. If staging code is so useful that people end up using it,
+       that means that it's basically regular kernel code with a flag saying
+       "please clean this up".
+
+       The other side of the coin is that people who talk about "API
+       stability" are entirely wrong. API's don't matter either. You can make
+       any changes to an API you like - as long as nobody notices.
+
+       Again, the regression rule is not about documentation, not about
+       API's, and not about the phase of the moon.
+
+       It's entirely about "we caused problems for user space that used to work".

+
+       Oh, if the kernel breaks some standard user space, that counts. Tons
+       of people run Debian unstable (and from my limited interactions with
+       it, for damn good reasons: -stable tends to run so old versions of

+
+       And our regression rule has never been "behavior doesn't change".
+       That would mean that we could never make any changes at all.
+
+       For example, we do things like add new error handling etc all the
+       time, which we then sometimes even add tests for in our kselftest
+       directory.
+
+       So clearly behavior changes all the time and we don't consider that a
+       regression per se.
+
+       The rule for a regression for the kernel is that some real user
+       workflow breaks. Not some test. Not a "look, I used to be able to do
+       X, now I can't".

+
+       YOU ARE MISSING THE #1 KERNEL RULE.
+
+       We do not regress, and we do not regress exactly because your are 100% wrong.
+
+       And the reason you state for your opinion is in fact exactly *WHY* you
+       are wrong.
+
+       Your "good reasons" are pure and utter garbage.
+
+       The whole point of "we do not regress" is so that people can upgrade
+       the kernel and never have to worry about it.
+
+       > Kernel had a bug which has been fixed
+
+       That is *ENTIRELY* immaterial.
+
+       Guys, whether something was buggy or not DOES NOT MATTER.
+
+       Why?
+
+       Bugs happen. That's a fact of life. Arguing that "we had to break
+       something because we were fixing a bug" is completely insane. We fix
+       tens of bugs every single day, thinking that "fixing a bug" means that
+       we can break something is simply NOT TRUE.
+
+       So bugs simply aren't even relevant to the discussion. They happen,
+       they get found, they get fixed, and it has nothing to do with "we
+       break users".
+
+       Because the only thing that matters IS THE USER.
+
+       How hard is that to understand?
+
+       Anybody who uses "but it was buggy" as an argument is entirely missing
+       the point. As far as the USER was concerned, it wasn't buggy - it
+       worked for him/her.
+
+       Maybe it worked *because* the user had taken the bug into account,
+       maybe it worked because the user didn't notice - again, it doesn't
+       matter. It worked for the user.
+
+       Breaking a user workflow for a "bug" is absolutely the WORST reason
+       for breakage you can imagine.
+
+       It's basically saying "I took something that worked, and I broke it,
+       but now it's better". Do you not see how f*cking insane that statement
+       is?
+
+       And without users, your program is not a program, it's a pointless
+       piece of code that you might as well throw away.
+
+       Seriously. This is *why* the #1 rule for kernel development is "we
+       don't break users". Because "I fixed a bug" is absolutely NOT AN
+       ARGUMENT if that bug fix broke a user setup. You actually introduced a
+       MUCH BIGGER bug by "fixing" something that the user clearly didn't
+       even care about.
+
+       And dammit, we upgrade the kernel ALL THE TIME without upgrading any
+       other programs at all. It is absolutely required, because flag-days
+       and dependencies are horribly bad.
+
+       And it is also required simply because I as a kernel developer do not
+       upgrade random other tools that I don't even care about as I develop
+       the kernel, and I want any of my users to feel safe doing the same
+       time.
+
+       So no. Your rule is COMPLETELY wrong. If you cannot upgrade a kernel
+       without upgrading some other random binary, then we have a problem.

+
+       THERE ARE NO VALID ARGUMENTS FOR REGRESSIONS.
+
+       Honestly, security people need to understand that "not working" is not
+       a success case of security. It's a failure case.
+
+       Yes, "not working" may be secure. But security in that case is *pointless*.

+
+       But we have the policy that regressions aren't about documentation or
+       even sane behavior.
+
+       Regressions are about whether a user application broke in a noticeable way.

+
+       Binary compatibility is more important.
+
+       And if binaries don't use the interface to parse the format (or just
+       parse it wrongly - see the fairly recent example of adding uuid's to
+       /proc/self/mountinfo), then it's a regression.
+
+       And regressions get reverted, unless there are security issues or
+       similar that makes us go "Oh Gods, we really have to break things".
+
+       I don't understand why this simple logic is so hard for some kernel
+       developers to understand. Reality matters. Your personal wishes matter
+       NOT AT ALL.
+
+       If you made an interface that can be used without parsing the
+       interface description, then we're stuck with the interface. Theory
+       simply doesn't matter.
+
+       You could help fix the tools, and try to avoid the compatibility
+       issues that way. There aren't that many of them.

+       "vmlinux", it's the kernel.
+
+       The only piece of user-space code we ship with the kernel is the system
+       call trampoline etc that the kernel sets up. THOSE interfaces we can
+       really change, because it changes with the kernel.

+
+       One _particularly_ last-minute revert is the top-most commit (ignoring
+       the version change itself) done just before the release, and while
+       it's very annoying, it's perhaps also instructive.
+
+       What's instructive about it is that I reverted a commit that wasn't
+       actually buggy. In fact, it was doing exactly what it set out to do,
+       and did it very well. In fact it did it _so_ well that the much
+       improved IO patterns it caused then ended up revealing a user-visible
+       regression due to a real bug in a completely unrelated area.
+
+       The actual details of that regression are not the reason I point that
+       revert out as instructive, though. It's more that it's an instructive
+       example of what counts as a regression, and what the whole "no
+       regressions" kernel rule means. The reverted commit didn't change any
+       API's, and it didn't introduce any new bugs. But it ended up exposing
+       another problem, and as such caused a kernel upgrade to fail for a
+       user. So it got reverted.
+
+       The point here being that we revert based on user-reported _behavior_,
+       not based on some "it changes the ABI" or "it caused a bug" concept.
+       The problem was really pre-existing, and it just didn't happen to
+       trigger before. The better IO patterns introduced by the change just
+       happened to expose an old bug, and people had grown to depend on the
+       previously benign behavior of that old issue.
+
+       And never fear, we'll re-introduce the fix that improved on the IO
+       patterns once we've decided just how to handle the fact that we had a
+       bad interaction with an interface that people had then just happened
+       to rely on incidental behavior for before. It's just that we'll have
+       to hash through how to do that (there are no less than three different
+       patches by three different developers being discussed, and there might
+       be more coming...). In the meantime, I reverted the thing that exposed
+       the problem to users for this release, even if I hope it will be
+       re-introduced (perhaps even backported as a stable patch) once we have
+       consensus about the issue it exposed.
+
+       Take-away from the whole thing: it's not about whether you change the
+       kernel-userspace ABI, or fix a bug, or about whether the old code
+       "should never have worked in the first place". It's about whether
+       something breaks existing users' workflow.
+
+       Anyway, that was my little aside on the whole regression thing.  Since
+       it's that "first rule of kernel programming", I felt it is perhaps
+       worth just bringing it up every once in a while.
