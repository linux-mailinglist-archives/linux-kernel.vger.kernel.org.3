I think we have time in the sense that the worst that happens is that
tooling picks the wrong CFMWS to dynamically create a region and the
performance ends up being sub-optimal. That's tolerable to work around
in userspace in the near term. I want to get some wider confidence in
the DOE ABI with respect to the known protocols and what to do about
the vendor-specific protocols that may conflict and will be driven
from userspace issued config-cycles. That likely means that no DOE ABI
is the best ABI to start which means not moving forward with
aux-devices so scripts do not become attached to something that is not
fully committed to being carried forward.

I still want to refresh the request_config_region() support for at
least having the kernel warn on userspace conflicting configuration
writes to config areas claimed by a driver.
