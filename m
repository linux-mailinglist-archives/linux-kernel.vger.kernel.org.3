Hm, good point about the stats. Could be tweaked perhaps so it appears
correct on the outside, but might be tricky.

It would be great if we would at least somehow hit the necessary code only
when dealing with a >=pageblock size block. The bitmap approach and
accepting everything smaller uprofront actually seems rather compatible. Yet
in the current patch we e.g. check PageUnaccepted(buddy) on every buddy size
while merging.

A list that sits besides the existing free_area, contains only >=pageblock
order sizes of unaccepted pages (no migratetype distinguished) and we tap
into it approximately before __rmqueue_fallback()? There would be some
trickery around releasing zone-lock for doing accept_memory(), but should be
manageable.
