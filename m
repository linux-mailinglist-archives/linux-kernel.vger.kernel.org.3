Yes it can be used in this manner but this is not the only way it was
intended to be used. The goal is to enable an integrator, e.g, a distro,
to incorporate Linux Secure Launch appropriately for their security
needs, though ideally it would be preferred that a standardized approach
is adopted by Linux init tooling to provide common experience across
distros. Up until the introduction of Secure Launch, the only widely
deployed model for DRTM has been to use tboot. Tboot is an MLE/DLME that
functions as an exokernel and an intermediate loader for the Runtime
OS/MLE. This motivated the first exemplar solution to be a Linux Secure
Launch + uroot solution that would provide a similar intermediate loader
experience, but with an expanded ability of the uroot to measure
additional properties about a system. As a result a distro could use the
exemplar to replace tboot, tboot VL policy tools, and VL policy file
with a Secure Launch kernel, a u-root initrd (built-in or standalone),
and a JSON policy file.

By no means was Secure Launch meant to be limited to only being used as
an intermediate loader for a Runtime OS. There is nothing that prohibits
a Runtime Linux system to be directly started using Secure Launch.
Though it should be noted that such a solution would need to be
cognizant of the security gap across power-save modes, whereby the OS
looses the positive control that it had over the system. It should also
be mentioned that one of the motivations behind DRTM late-launch via
kexec is to provide a path for dealing with this gap by enabling a
late-launch to re-establish a known good state of the system. These all
can be considered the advanced use cases for Secure Launch.

To continue from the answer above and lead into answering your question
I would first point to a presentation I gave at LPC 2020, Advanced
Applications of DRTM with TrenchBoot[1]. There I walked through how
Secure Launch could be used for different early-launch and late-launch
DRTM solutions. Under the late-launch solutions there is the "Secure
Upgrade" solutions. What I laid out there is that DRTM could be used to
launch an "Upgrade Environment" which could be locally or remotely
verified and provide a known-good and clean environment to upgrade a
system. What an implementation of that actually looks like can be seen
in the presentation by Brain Payne and myself at FOSDEM 2021, Secure
Upgrades with DRTM[2]. In this presentation the concept of a Management
MLE is introduced to provide a secure means to upgrade the Runtime MLE
along with its related policy and sealing measurements.

Now the above, like most local verification, relies on the unseal
operation as the means of local attestation. Using unseal is strong but
the reality is that remote attestation is stronger. The problem is that
remote attestation is often built as an enterprise solutions requiring a
central server/service under the control of an authority that decides
what is good or bad. Often the average user either does not have access
to such a service or does not desire to out-source control over their
system. To address this I am collaborating with 3mdeb on their Fobnail
product[3][4][5] to deliver an "attestation server in your pocket"
capability that is accessible and usable by the average user.

The answer so far is around solutions that were built from/around the
TrenchBoot project but Linux Secure Launch does not require new, special
user solutions. These solutions have been developed because DRTM enables
them to exist, not that they are the only ways Linux Secure Launch can
be utilized. For instance it is possible to setup a Clevis[6] based LUKS
full disk encryption setup using clevis' TPM2 PIN, where the TPM2 PIN
configuration uses the DRTM PCRs (17-22) as part of sealing PCRs for the
encryption key.
