The ECR was approved at last week's meeting, it'll be in the next UEFI
spec.  Details of what spec version that'll be and when it will
officially be released are still under discussion, but it's been
approved in its current form.  Microsoft has been kind enough to provide
us code for test firmware, though the build process is a little rough.

I've done some builds of it here: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/pjones/mu-qemuq35/builds/ .
The src rpm there is a bit absurdly large, because I've done the very
quick-and-dirty hack of just shoving a pile of git repos into it instead
of trying to make release tarballs of everything, and it needs the
network enabled to rebuild it for fairly dumb reasons.  But the result
is a firmware that works in QEMU.

It works for the bootloaders in my development trees; I've booted a
kernel with your patches.  From the bootloader POV we do need one more
simple patch to enable the compatibility flag in the headers, I'll send
it as a follow-up to this mail.
