This failure cannot occur in conforming PCI hardware.  I guess if you
want to propagate the error from mvebu_pcie_add_windows() back to
mvebu_pci_bridge_emul_base_conf_write() and do something there, I'm OK
with that.

But change the commit log so it doesn't say "... and correctly update
PCI_IO_BASE, PCI_MEM_BASE and PCI_IO_BASE_UPPER16" because this is
completely device-specific behavior and is not "correct" per any PCI
spec.

Instead, say something about how mvebu doesn't support arbitrary
windows and we're disabling the window completely if we can't provide
what's requested.  

Maybe this error warrants a clue in dmesg?  How would a user figure
out what's going on in this situation?  From the patch, it looks like
we would assign resources to a device, but the device just would not
work because the root port window was silently disabled?
