Move some out-of-place kernel parameters into their correct
locations.

Move one out-of-order keyword/legend in kernel-parameters.rst.

Add some missing keyword legends in kernel-parameters.rst:
  HIBERNATION HYPER_V
and drop some obsolete/removed keyword legends:
 EIDE IOSCHED OSS TS XT

Correct the location of the setup.h file.
