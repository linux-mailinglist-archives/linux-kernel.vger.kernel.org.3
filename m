Yup.  I went through that (between RFC v1 and RFC v2) and it wasn't pretty
- maybe it's worth a revisit though.

To throw another view point in the mix. Note that I want a solution and
in my view DOE is slow and never on a fast path + I don't see it being
high churn code so needs to be fairly maintainable but not super simple
or architecturally clean (at the level of state machines / work queues etc
- interfaces need to be clean!)

If we go back to RFC v1, which IIRC was basically queue on a mutex, and
consider it in the light of where we've ended up.  I wussed out on arguing much
about this at the time because consensus + moving forward was more
important to me than the chosen architecture.

Taking a slightly black and white view of requirements. I don't think
we loose anything by using this list...

1. Synchronous (if anyone needs async at level of caller, they can spin
   a thread up).  Async is the corner case, not the common one.
2. Small number (< 3 I'm guessing) of protocols per instance.
3. Very rare there is significant contention.  Fairness doesn't matter.
   Normally the only reason we'd get contention is userspace triggering
   access to multiple protocols at a time - probably via sysfs or other slow
   method.
4. Per protocol ordering can be maintained by the protocol, not the DOE layer.
5. DOE is basically a bus over which we are talking to different devices
  - think of it like I2C but rather than address we have protocol IDs.

That last analogy brings us back to how I think almost all slow buses are
handled.

At level of a bus, a lock is used for mutual exclusion (often also protecting
bus controller register state etc). No workqueues or similar complexity
- Underlying hardware typically doing DMA of result into a provided buffer
with only one transaction in flight at that layer at anyone time.
Note there is more complex handling for high perf cases, but in many cases
its not really used.

We have a bus lock that can ensure exclusion over sequences if necessary
(there's one in SPI).

If a given driver needs to ensure exclusion for RMW or similar sequences
of operations it takes a driver specific mutex and holds it across these
sequences of slow operations, which usually sleep, include interrupts and all
sorts of fun.  Normally there is a completion in there somewhere to
get from the 'done' interrupt on the bus controller back to the
i2c_smbus_bus_read() etc that is waiting on the result.

This model works, is super simple and layered.

In case of no contention (perhaps 99% of time), it immediately runs the
DOE/bus access in the thread that made the read/write request.
So no overhead of going to a workqueue.  

Implementation is one linear function, no state machine needed.

Anyhow, to refer back to my initial comment.  I'm not that fussed on how
we do this but it's a blocker on other work so quick solution is more
important to me than perfect one.
