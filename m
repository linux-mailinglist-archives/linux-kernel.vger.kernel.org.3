Thanks for confirming that.

Yes, I think something along this line will help.

I think users of FLR should be able to rely on it working per spec,
i.e., that VFs will be destroyed.  If hardware like hns3 doesn't do
that, the quirk should work around that in software by doing it
explicitly.

I don't think the non-standard behavior should be exposed to the
users.  The user should not have to know about this hns3 issue.

If FLR on a standard NIC terminates a ping on a VF, FLR on an hns3 NIC
should also terminate a ping on a VF.
