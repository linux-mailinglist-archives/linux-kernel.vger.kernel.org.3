It's possible ... any orchestration system that doesn't enter a user
namespace has to strictly regulate capabilities.   I'm probably biased
because I always use a user_ns so I never really had to mess with
capabilities.

Well docker doesn't use the user_ns.  But even given that,
CAP_SYS_ADMIN is always dropped for most container systems.  What
happens when you enter a user namespace is the ns_capable( ...,
CAP_SYS_ADMIN) check returns true if you're the owner of the user_ns,
in the same way it would for root.  So effectively entering a user
namespace without CAP_SYS_ADMIN but mapping the owner id to 0 (what
unshare -r --user does) gives you back a form of CAP_SYS_ADMIN that
responds only in the places in the kernel that have a ns_capable()
check instead of a capable() one (most of the places you list below). 
This is the principle of how unprivileged containers actually work ...
and the source of some of our security problems if you get back an
ability to do something you shouldn't be allowed to do as an
unprivileged user.

I don't see why not, but other container people should weigh in
because, as I said, I mostly use the user namespace and unprivileged
containers and don't bother with capabilities.
