Thanks for the discussion all. I think we've landed on the fact that this
is a refcounting bug that needs to be fixed, but isn't a leak in how the
kobject implementation exists today.

Petr - are you OK with me sending out a v3 of the patch with the following
changes:
  - The patch description is updated to not claim that a leak is being
    fixed, but rather that a kobject reference counting bug is being fixed.
  - All of the NULL checking in klp_init_patch_early() is brought into
    klp_enable_patch(), and klp_init_patch_early() is updated to be void,
    per Josh's suggestion. This would address the refcounting issue and IMO
    also simplifies and improves the code. I know you were onboard with
    moving try_module_get() into klp_enable_patch(), but I don't think we
    ever resolved the point about moving the rest of the NULL checking out
    as well.

Regards,
David
