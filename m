Yes.

I mentioned it because there is mbigen on arm64 which is the same thing,
translates hundreds of wire inputs into MSI. It's even worse than
IO/APIC. There is a horrible hack to make it "work" which Marc and I are
looking at whether we can kill it on the way.

Not really. It was more to avoid having a complete separate
infrastructure for irqdomain based MSI[X]. Lazyness and lack of time
added the rest of non-motivation :)

I cant avoid irq chips because from the interrupt handling side of view
that's unavoidable unless we create a duplicate zoo there. What I have
in mind is to convert the msi ops provided by the device driver into a
real chip as that just falls in place without further changes.

The irqdomain will be real as well just to make things consistent and to
share as much code as possible.

That might work. Let's see when we are there.

I've done that before. It just needs some thought.

Thanks,
