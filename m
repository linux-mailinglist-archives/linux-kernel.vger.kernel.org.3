Good point. I'll address that in v3.

Yes, this was the primary and only motivation. <*, id> is much clearer and I'm
with you on finding a better alternative.

I think this is better than just obj, but in my opinion this may be confusing
for readers and look like a typo. I think I prefer your second suggestion,
though obj really makes more sense in the case where we're actually passing an
@obj to the function. I'll probably (deservedly?) get lambasted for suggesting
this, but what about taking a page out of rust's book and doing something like
this:

  * klp_shadow_free_all() - detach and free all <_, id> shadow variables
  *		with the given @id.

to indicate that in this case we don't care about the obj. Even for a reader
unfamiliar with rust, hopefully it would get the point across.

I'm fine with this as well. Let me know what you think about <_, id> vs. what
you suggested, and I'll send out the v3 patch with your preference.

Indeed you're correct. There's no warning in the build system because there
happen to be two <*, id> ... <*, id> in a row, so rst happily italicizes what's
between them without question. I'll fix this in the v3 of the patch as well.

> Otherwise, the patch looks fine to me.

Thanks for taking a look and for the helpful suggestions.
