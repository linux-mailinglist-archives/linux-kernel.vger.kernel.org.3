Yes, you're right, the correct way is to find and fix the issues that
make us to use this "force" transition interface, until we don't need
to use it.

Apart from this reason, another reason we may use "force" transition
is that we want to speed up the transition process of some patches
when load them, and we can make sure these patches are safe to do so.
(just like a consistency model check disable option when load a patch)

Then I find it confusing and limited that force transition in loading
a patch will make all previous patches can't be unloaded, so can't be
reverted and enabled again (updated or not).

Anyway, I think this patch won't decrease the security performance of
livepatch, but can increase flexibility in some user experience.

Thanks.
