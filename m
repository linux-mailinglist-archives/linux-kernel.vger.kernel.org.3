I don't really have enough knowledge about IMA and how it is used to decide on
one approach or the other.  Note that earlier I mentioned that it would be
possible to have an fs-verity setting that makes a full file digest be included
in the fsverity_descriptor, so it gets covered by the fs-verity file digest and
is also retrievable in constant time like the fs-verity file digest is.

If you'd like to solve this problem at the IMA layer instead, by storing the
full file digest in an xattr and signing both the full file digest and fs-verity
file digest together, that would achieve the same goal of making the full file
digest available, and wouldn't require any changes to fs-verity.  This would
assume that the file would be signed, though.  What about audit-only mode
without signatures; is that something you care about?

Alternatively, maybe this problem doesn't need to be solved at all and IMA would
be fine with the fs-verity file digest only, and not need the full file hash
too.  I don't know the answer to that; I think it's up to you to decide.
