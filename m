Hello My Dear,

It's my pleasure to contact you to seek for your urgent assistance in
this humanitarian social investment project to be establish in your
country for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileged
ones, haven't known each other or met before, I know that everything
is controlled by God as there is nothing impossible to him. I believe
that you and I can cooperate together in the service of the Lord,
please open your heart to assist me in carrying out this benevolently
project in your country/position. I am Mrs.Marie Benbow Candice, a
dying widow hospitalized undergoing treatment for brain tumor disease,
I believe that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence
that I am about to entrust on you for the mutual benefit of the
orphans and the less privileged ones. My late husband made a
substantial deposit with the Bank which I have decided to hand over
and entrust the sum of ($12,000,000.Dollar) in the account under your
custody for you to invest it into any social charitable project in
your location or your country. Based on my present health status I am
permanently indisposed to handle finances or any financial related
project.

This is the reason why I decided to contact you for your support and
help to stand as my rightful beneficiary and claim the money for
humanitarian purposes for the mutual benefits of the less privileged
ones. Because If the money remains unclaimed with the bank after my
death, those greedy bank executives will place the money as an
unclaimed Fund and share it for their selfish and worthless ventures.
However I need your sincerity and ability to carry out this
transaction and fulfill my final wish in implementing the charitable
investment project in your country as it requires absolute trust and
devotion without any failure. Meanwhile It will be my pleasure to
compensate you with part of the total money as my Investment
manager/partner for your effort in handling the transaction, while the
remaining amount shall be invested into any charity project of your
choice there in your country.

=C2=A0Please I'm waiting for your prompt response if only you are
interested. I will send you further details and the bank contact
details where the fund has been deposited for you to contact the Bank
for immediate release and transfer of the fund into your bank account
as my rightful beneficiary.

Respectfully,

Mrs.Marie Benbow Candice.
