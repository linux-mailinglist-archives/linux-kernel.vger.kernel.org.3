Unfortunately, I see a last problem here. I see a double change:
(1) a bfqg is now counted only as a function of the state of its child
    queues, and not of also its child bfqgs
(2) the state considered for counting a bfqg moves from having pending
    requests to having busy queues

I'm ok with with (1), which is a good catch (you are lady explained
the idea to me some time ago IIRC).

Yet I fear that (2) is not ok.  A bfqq can become non busy even if it
still has in-flight I/O, i.e.  I/O being served in the drive.  The
weight of such a bfqq must still be considered in the weights_tree,
and the group containing such a queue must still be counted when
checking whether the scenario is asymmetric.  Otherwise service
guarantees are broken.  The reason is that, if a scenario is deemed as
symmetric because in-flight I/O is not taken into account, then idling
will not be performed to protect some bfqq, and in-flight I/O may
steal bandwidth to that bfqq in an uncontrolled way.

I verified this also experimentally a few years ago, when I added this
weights_tree stuff.  That's the rationale behind the part of
bfq_weights_tree_remove that this patch eliminates.  IOW,
for a bfqq and its parent bfqg to be out of the count for symmetry,
all bfqq's requests must also be completed.

Thanks,
Paolo
