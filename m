Thanks for clarifying.

IMO, the code will look better if we keep the suspend and resume paths in
sync. Since we are calling pci_disable_ptm() in suspend path, it makes
sense to call pci_enable_ptm() in resume path.

Making the pci_enable_ptm() handle root and upstream ports should not
be very complicated, right?

I agree with you. We should not touch PCI_PTM_CTRL_ROOT in pci_disable_ptm().
