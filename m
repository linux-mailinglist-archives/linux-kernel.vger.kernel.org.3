Was this patch in response to a syzkaller report?  There wasn't a
Reported-by tag indicating that this came from syzkaller.  If it did,
and it came from syzkaller run by the syzkaller team (e.g., at
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream) could you include a reference
to the syzkaller report?

That's true; however, in general, if we can back out and recover from
the error, we should, so that errors=continue can work.  If we think
that continuing will result in far more file system corruption and/or
the error is from the journalling infrastructure itself, then aborting
the journal makes sense.

It would not be a bad thing for us to audit all of the callers of
ext4_mark_inode_dirty() and ext4_reserve_inode_write().  We are
getting things right in at least some of the callers (for example:
ext4_mkdir).

In any case, I'll take this patch, but if this was in response to a
syzkaller report, please let me know with the syzkaller ID is, so I
can update the commit before I send a pull request to Linus.

Thanks!
