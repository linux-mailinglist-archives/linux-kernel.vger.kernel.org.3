This code is common for auxdev cleanup. AFAICT most auxiliary bus code is done by drivers that have
some other primary function. They clean up their primary function resources in remove, but they
clean up the auxdev using the method above. In this case the sole purpose of this driver is to
create the auxdev. There are no other resources beyond what the auxdev is using.

Adding runtime pm to the pci driver will change this. Remove will be needed then.

It happens when the device is removed as tested by unbinding it.

Sure, but I don't think it's that odd in practice given what I already mentioned.
