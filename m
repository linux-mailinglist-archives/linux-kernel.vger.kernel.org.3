Add PMU events for Arm Cortex-A510
Add corresponding common events
Update mapfile.csv

Event data based on:
https://github.com/ARM-software/data/tree/master/pmu/cortex-a510.json

which is based on PMU event descriptions from the Arm Cortex-A510 Technical
Reference Manual.

Common event data based on:
https://github.com/ARM-software/data/blob/master/pmu/common_armv9.json

which is based on PMU event descriptions found in the Arm Architecture
Reference Manual:
https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/

Mapping data (for mapfile.csv) based on:
https://github.com/ARM-software/data/blob/master/cpus.json

which is based on Main ID Register (MIDR) information found in the Arm
Technical Reference Manuals for individual CPUs.
