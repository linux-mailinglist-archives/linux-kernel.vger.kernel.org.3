That is my intention too, no more new regression.

I do agree it is not reasonable to ask you to fix them,Â  just compare 
the test result
with and without your set, at least there is no more new failure as said.

Let's focus on raid456 test given the code only touches raid5, you can 
pass argument
like this, FYI.

mdadm> ./test --raidtype=raid456 --dev=loop
