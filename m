My dear I am Miss Lisha Haman 23 years of age , I am the only daughter
to Dr Abdul Haman from France-Paris who work with (SEMAFO) the biggest
Canadian gold producer here in West Africa Burkina Faso,

Unfortunately my father was a victim on the deadliest attack by the
jihadist On the 6 November 2019 when gunmen ambushed a convoy
transporting workers of the Canadian mining firm Semafo, it is my sad
moment each time I think about this, but the reason why I contacted
you is that I have my late father receipt of deposit he made with a
bank in abroad with my name as next of kin, The total amount deposited
was 3.7 million United Stated dollars,

Now I decided to travel for the money but embassy here deny me visa
due to the Corona virus outbreak,

I talk to the bank regarding my visa problem and they advise me to
look for my relative trusted bank account so that they will transfer
the total fund in there, But I am the only daughter of my father and
have no relative to present, that is why I want to present you to the
bank as my relative who will receive the total fund on my behalf and
also take care of me as well,

please send me your complete

full details such as, Your Full Name:

Home and Office Addresses:

Telephone Number:

Occupation:

Country of Residence:

Your Bank account number where the bank will remit the fund

Once I received your details, I will give you the bank contact so that
you can contact them directly to discuss how they can transfer the
total fund in your bank account so that you can relocate me to join
you over there in your country,

Sincerely

LishaHaman225@gmail.com

Miss Lisha Haman
