Ok. I'll rebase it on top of v5.19-rcX on the next cycle.

Alas this will be very unluckily to happen. They have been inactive
for more than four months on this and the rest of the patchsets
(that's how long the patchsets have been hanging out on review).
The last commit authored by Gustavo was the commit ce31ff786ddf
("PCI: dwc: Fix 'cast truncates bits from constant value'") posted
in Sep 22, 2020 and no review activity afterwards. Jingoo' last
ack was in Jun 25, 2019. So two and three years of silence accordingly
doesn't give any hope on the sooner reaction from them.

I do understand the standard approach, but in this case it seems like
the official maintainers've abandoned the drivers (DW PCIe and eDMA).
That's why I offered my hands (at least twice) in looking for both DW
PCIe and eDMA drivers seeing none of the maintainers have shown any
sign of interest in reviewing the submitted cleanup/fixes/features
patches (there are about 110 patches I've submitted altogether).
