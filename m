It seems I lost few words in my message, so let me write it again, but
maybe closer to English:

To trivial-devices you should add only bindings of really trivial
devices, which do not have any other properties, even when the bindings
are finished. This means you describe fully the hardware and still have
only reg+compatible.

If this device fits such case - no other hardware properties than reg -
then, feel free to document it in trivial-devices. However I am not sure
that TPM devices are that trivial... For example tpm-i2c.txt defines
also interrupts and label.

If the device is not trivial, it should be documented in bindings,
either dedicated or some existing ones.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
