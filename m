"the sched domains and the load balancer" you mentioned are the ways to 
"balance" tasks on each domains. However, this patchset aims to "group" 
them together to win hot cache and less competition, which is different 
from load balancer. See commit log of the patch 3/4 and this link:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/11d4c86a-40ef-6ce5-6d08-e9d0bc9b512a@linux.alibaba.com/

Group balancer mainly needs 2 inputs from userspace: cpu partition info 
and cgroup info.
Cpu partition info does need user input (and maybe a bit complicated). 
As a result, the division methods are __free__ to users(can refer to 
NUMA nodes, clusters, cache, etc.)
Cgroup info doesn't need extra input. It's naturally configured.

It do parametrize the existing load balancer to behave better.
Group balancer is a kind of optimize policy, and should obey the basic
policy (load balance) and improve it.
The relationship between load balancer and group balancer is explained 
in detail at the above link.

We put group balancer in kernel space because this new policy does not 
depend on userspace apps. It's a "general" feature.
Doing "dynamic cpuset" in userspace may also introduce performance 
issue, since it may need to bind and unbind different cpusets for 
several times, and is too strict(compared with our "soft bind").
