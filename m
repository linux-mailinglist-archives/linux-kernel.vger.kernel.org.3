Reading the code?
Or you mean, in the commit description this should be mentioned?
I can do that, if you prefer.

I don't think it is so simple - we are in the panic path.
So, imagine the lock was taken in CPU0, where GSMI is doing some
operation. During that operation, CPU1 panics!

When that happens, panic() executes in CPU1, disabling CPU0 through
"strong" mechanisms (NMI). So, CPU0 had the lock, it is now off, and
when CPU1 goes through the panic notifiers, it'll eventually wait
forever for this lock in the GSMI handler, unless we have this patch
that would prevent the handler to run in such case.
Makes sense?
