Since when is unloading modules something that is expected to work
perfectly? I keep hearing "well, don't do that then" when someone
complains about unloading this module while doing this or that broke
something. (And it's only root that can unload modules in the first
place.)

If this was the general understanding, then it seems the only option
would be to disable module unloading completely as module remove code
almost by definition gets less testing and is subject to bit rot.

It's useful for developers, but use it at your own risk.

That said, I agree that if something is next to impossible to get right,
as may be the case with interrupt controllers generally, then fine,
let's disable module unloading for that class of drivers.

And this would mean disabling driver unbind for the 20+ driver PCI
drivers that currently implement it to some degree.

Also note that we only appear to have some 60 drivers in the tree that
can be built as modules but cannot be unloaded (if my grep patterns
were correct).

That is precisely the way I've been testing it and everything appears
to be tore down as it should.

And a PCI driver that has been unbound should have released its
resources, or that's a driver bug. Right?

And for the OF INTx case you mentioned earlier, aren't those mapped by
PCI core and could in theory be released by core as well?
