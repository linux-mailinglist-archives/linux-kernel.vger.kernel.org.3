Hi, Paolo

1) At first, patch 1 support to track if bfqq has pending requests, it's
done by setting the flag 'entity->in_groups_with_pending_reqs' when the
first request is inserted to bfqq, and it's cleared when the last
request is completed.

2) Then, patch 2 add a counter in bfqg: how many bfqqs have pending
requests, which is updated while tracking if bfqq has pending requests.

3) Finally, patch 3 tracks 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs' based on the
new counter in patch 2:
  - if the counter(how many bfqqs have pending requests) increased from 0
    to 0, increase 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs'.
  - if the counter is decreased from 1 to 0, decrease
    'num_groups_with_pending_reqs'

If this patchset is applied, there are following cleanup patches to
remove this function.

multiple cleanup patches for bfq:

Same as above, if this patch is applied, this function will be gone.
