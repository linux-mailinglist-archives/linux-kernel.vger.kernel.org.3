I must say that I don't really get the objection against the watchdog
approach. OK, there is no userspace aspect to this.  But we already
use watchdogs for more than just userspace (reboot is one of the major
use cases).

There already are per-CPU watchdog in the tree: see how the
fsl-ls208xa platform has one SP805 per CPU (8 of them in total). As
far as I can tell, there was no objection to this. So what is special
about this one?

Thanks,

	M.
