A little crazy is a good thing sometimes.

I am thinking of implementing a DWARF verifier to make sure that the DWARF information
in .debug_frame is correct. I am still in the process of designing this. I will keep
you posted on that. This should address (a) and (c).

As for (b), the compiler does not generate any DWARF rules for ASM code. DWARF
annotations are a PITA to maintain. So, in my current design regular ASM functions are 
considered unreliable from an unwind perspective except the places that have unwind
hints. Unwind hints are only needed for places that tend to occur frequently in stack
traces. So, it would be just a handful of unwind hints which can be maintained.

As you know, ASM functions come in two flavors - SYM_CODE() functions and SYM_FUNC()
functions. SYM_CODE functions are, by definition, unreliable from an unwind perspective
because they don't follow ABI rules and they don't set up any frame pointer. In my
reliable stack trace patch series, I have a patch based on the opinion of the reviewers
to mark these functions so the unwinder can recognize them and declare the stack trace
unreliable. So, the only ASM functions that matter in (b) are the SYM_FUNC functions.
For now, I have considered them to be unreliable. But I will analyze those functions to
see if any of them can occur frequently in stack traces. If some of these functions
can occur frequently in stack traces, I need to address them. I will see if unwind hints
are a good fit. I will get back to you on this.

This is a valid point. So far, I find that gcc generates reliable DWARF information.
But there are two bugs in what Clang generates. I have added workarounds in my
parser to compensate.

So, I think a DWARF verifier is an option that architectures can use. At this point,
I don't want to mandate a verifier on every architecture. But that is a discussion
that we can have once I have a verifier ready.

Yes. That is my thinking as well. When the unwinder checks the actual FP with the
computed FP, any mismatch will be treated as unreliable code for unwind. So,
apart from some retries during the livepatch process, this is most probably not
a problem.

Now,  I set a flag for an unwind hint so that the unwinder knows that it is
processing an unwind hint. I could generate a warning if an unwind hint does not
result in a reliable unwind of the frame. This would bring the broken hint
to people's attention.

Exactly.

OK. I will rename it.

I will certainly look into it. So, if I decide to merge the two, I might want
to make a minor change to the ORC structure. Would that be OK with you?

First off, I think that objtool does a great job for X64. I only want to implement
frame pointer validation in a different way. All the other features of objtool
(listed below) are great. I have admired the amount of work you guys have put into
the X64 part.

These are the reasons why I tried the DWARF based method:

- My implementation is largely architecture independent. There are a couple of
  minor pieces that are architecture-specific, but they are minor in nature.
  So, if an architecture wanted to support the livepatch feature but did not
  want to do a heavy weight objtool implementation, then it has an option.
  There has been some debate about whether static analysis should be mandated
  for livepatch. My patch series is an attempt to provide an option.

- To get an objtool static analysis implementation working for an architecture
  as reliably as X64 and getting it reviewed and upstreamed can take years. It took
  years for X64, am I right? I mean, it has been quite a while since the original
  patch series for arm64 was posted. There have been only one or two minor comments
  so far. I am sure arm64 linux users would very much want to have livepatch available
  ASAP to be able to install security fixes without downtime. This is an immediate need.

- No software is bug free. So, even if static analysis is implemented for an architecture,
  it would be good to have another method of verifying the unwind rules generated from
  the static analysis. DWARF can provide that additional verification.

I completely agree.

So, it is just frame pointer validation for livepatch I am trying to look at.
