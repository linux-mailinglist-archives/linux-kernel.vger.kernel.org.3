Manyi, FYI, your emails aren't making it to the linux-pci list (or to
me), so I'm missing most of this conversation.

If you look at the lore archive:
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220713112612.6935-1-limanyi@uniontech.com/
you'll see all the message-ids that are not found.

Maybe you're sending HTML or something else vger doesn't like?
