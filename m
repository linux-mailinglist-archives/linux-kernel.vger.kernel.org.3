Yeah, that doesn't seem right at all.

You're doing this under KVM, right?  Is the gadget driver running in the 
host OS or the guest OS?  And the sysfs file accesses -- are they in the 
host's filesystem or in the guest's?

What happens if you don't use KVM and just load the gadget driver on the 
physical machine?

The eject command should set the "file" attribute to an empty string all 
by itself, with no need for you to do anything else.

I don't understand that comment.  In what case?  Works better than what?

That can't possibly be right.  Again, we may be miscommunicating because 
of the way you're using KVM.

What happens if you set up the gadget using g-mass-storage instead of 
configfs?  For example:

	modprobe g-mass-storage cdrom=y removable=y ro=y file=...

> Could we add both device attrs and configfs file?

No.  Configfs files are for setting up the gadget in the first place, or 
changing its configuration while it isn't attached to a host.  Device 
attribute files are for modifying the gadget while it is running.
