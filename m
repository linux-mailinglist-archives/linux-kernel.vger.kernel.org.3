Firstly, wasn't this done before 8ef35c866f88 -- and initializing the NUMA
crng even if not enough entropy had been obtained yet?

Secondly, this approach seems works for small amounts of entropy submitted
to add_bootloader_randomness (e.g. for four calls with 8 bytes), but not for
larger quantities (e.g. for four calls with 64 bytes). Don't ask me why,
though.

Thirdly, this still does not fix the issue that only the second call to
add_bootloader_randomness() credits entropy.

Thanks,
	Dominik
