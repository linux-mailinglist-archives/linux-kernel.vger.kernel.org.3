The coordination looks perfect to me: Patrick started (and finished, as 
it only took an hour or two) the implementation two weeks and six days 
after your post saying you'd start in 3-4 weeks, so presumably you 
hadn't started yet and thus we just saved you some time -- I certainly 
always appreciate folks helping out, doubly so when it seems urgent (as 
this did at the time).

IMO the real coordination miss was that there's already been a much more 
comprehensive implementation of these in one of the RISC-V branches for 
months now, so it looks like this was all finished before any of us even 
started.  Probably best to go talk about this on the binutils mailing 
list, as that's where most of the relevant folks hang out.

Sorry to have stepped on your toes here, I guess this isn't nearly as 
urgent as I thought it was.  I'm in no particular rush for this one, so 
sounds like it can wait for the toolchain stuff to get sorted out
