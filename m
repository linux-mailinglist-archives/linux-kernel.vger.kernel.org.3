OK, now that triggered another question/thought.

1. Do you need to do active power management for these PMUs ? Or like
   CPU PMUs, do you reject entering low power states if there is active
   session in progress. If there is active session, runtime PM won't get
   triggered but if there is system wide suspend, how is that dealt with ?

2. Assuming you need some sort of PM, and since this is static table(which
   I really don't like/prefer but it is out there üôÅ), how do you plan to
   get the power domain related information.
