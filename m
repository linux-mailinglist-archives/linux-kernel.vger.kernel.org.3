I think you can define a "ranges" property in the parent node that
converts the MBUS address into a fake PCI MEM space address,
and this is what the Armada 385 example does with
<0x82000000 0 0x80000 MBUS_ID(0xf0, 0x01) 0x80000 0 0x00002000>
In the child you can refer to this using the "assigned-addresses"
property and then use the "ranges" to ensure that only the actual
IO and MEM space addresses are translated.

The alternative would be to do away with the indirection and make
the orion5x variant be more like a single hostbridge, and getting
rid of the fake parent. This is closer to what orion5x does at the
moment with the old driver, but might be harder to integrate into
the new one.

I recently checked the sizes as I was researching which boards are actually
still usable, and I can confirm what Andrew also said. The only one with
256MB is TS409, everything else has 32MB to 128MB.

As I said before, I also see no problem with leaving the smaller mapping,
as we know that nobody has ever used the extended config space on
orion5x with mainline kernels, and we are not trying to support new
hardware.

Right.
