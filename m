Thanks for the analysis and sorry for the late reply.

My test is rather simple.

echo 1 > sriov_numvfs # enable 1 VF
echo 1 > reset # trigger FLR

Both PFs' net are down and VF is not used.

Not sure. I tested again once the machine booted up, but with the same result.
Maybe I need to check whether the PCI link is ok.

Focus on this patch, does PF driver of mellanox needs to do something in the VF destroying?
The PF driver may not realized the VF is going to destroy as we're not destroying VF through
PF's ->sriov_configure() callback.

BTW, the mellanox doesn't reset IOV state either on a FLR resetting, is it intended as a feature?

Thanks,
Yicong
