It depends on the schema usage. Please see my next comments for the
detailed explanation what I am trying to achieve here and why it would
be very useful.

I see your point, but in this case I suppose an exception would gain
good benefits too. Here is why.

As I said in the patch log the main idea of this modification was to
create a common schema for the DW PCIe compatible controllers which would
be more restrictive than the existing one but more descriptive and yet
extendable if required. So using $refs was the best method for such
case.

In the framework of this patch aside with a set of the generic DW PCIe
properties, I tried to implement the schemas for the string array with
a pre-defined set values. These schemas can be used to set the
constraints on the device-specific bindings or can be omitted if
either the bindings have already been defined in a different way or
the device is incompatible with the generic bindings for some reason.
Please see the schemas defined in the pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml
file.

As you can see mainly the snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml schema contains the
normal properties descriptions like 'reg', 'clocks', 'interrupts',
'resets', etc. The only peculiarity is the sub-properties defined under
the "$defs" property. See, they aren't used in that file, but are
referenced in the snps,dw-pcie-ep.yaml and snps,dw-pcie.yaml schemas in
order to create the corresponding string arrays constraints. See my
next comments for the further explanation.

No, if the defined here "reg-names" schema is correctly referenced. See my

Please see the way the "$defs: *-names" properties are referenced in
the framework of this patch. My idea was to define a set of strings in
the "$defs: *-names" properties here. Then re-use that set to define
the device-specific constraints. That's why I've intentionally used
'oneOf'-based composition so the properties could be used to set a
constraints on !each! item of the corresponding strings array, but not
on the whole array as you suggest by replacing 'oneOf' with 'items'.
BTW the ordering can be defined in the corresponding schemas if it's
required. 

As an example please see the json schema of the generic DWC
PCIe End-point reg-names property I am trying to achieve here:
https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/s/eGV3M3gK

As you can see it makes sure the reg-names array contains at least
the "dbi", "dbi2" and "addr_space" strings and may also have the
optional CSR names if it's specific to the corresponding platform.

If you need the ordered set of the strings then the next schema
can be used:
https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/s/53KKrXV9

Regarding the ordering. As I see it, it isn't something what we need
in the modern bindings in the reference to the "*-names" properties
since the new drivers mainly rely on getting the CSR maps, interrupts,
clocks and resets by their names rather than a position in the 'reg'
phandles array. The CSRs order isn't something what hardware defines
either. Moreover tons of the DT source files don't really have the
reg-names, clock-names, etc properties initialized with some strict
order. So if we want the schema to be applicable for the already
created DT sources the ordering constraints need to be avoided.

Getting back to the patch. As I said in the patch log, alas I failed
to reproduce the described schema in the DT bindings due to the
denoted error. Seeing the JSON-schema examples are working and so does
the DT-schema parser if I manually move the "$defs: *-names" schemas
content in the place of the references, there must be some problem
with the parser. That's why I asked your help with debugging.

Well, in general this reg-space is supposed to be of the same memory
space type - outbound iATU sub-region - for both Host and End-point
controller, but the names are different for them. Anyway basically you
are right, the schemas referencing this property will permit having
both reg names. I can split this property up into two: "$defs:
host-reg-names" and "$defs: ep-reg-names" and use the new schemas in
the Host and EP reg-names property constraints respectively. What do
you think?

I am fully agree with you but the addr/config-space reg-bindings have
already been defined that way. It is implemented in the DWC PCIe driver
and many DT files rely on having that bindings implemented. So alas
nothing we can do about it.

I agree, but these names have already been referenced in some glue
drivers so does the DW PCIe Host/EP manual have the PHY/PCS CSRs IO
interface described. Thus we have to have them described here for the
sake of compatibility.

No, this property is supposed to be considered as applicable to each
"interrupt-names" item, not for the whole array. Please see my comments
before.
