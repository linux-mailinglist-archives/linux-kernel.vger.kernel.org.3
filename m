My understanding of the the Apple PCIe hardware is somewhat limited but:

So far all available machines only have PCIe devices that are soldered
onto the motherboard, so there are no "real" slots.  As far as we can
tell the PCIe power domain is already powered on at the point where
the m1n1 bootloader takes control.  There is a GPIO that controls
power to some devices (WiFi, SDHC on the M1 Pro/Max laptops) and those
devices are initially powered off.  The Linux driver doesn't currently
attempt to power these devices on, but U-Boot will power them on if
the appropriate GPIO is defined in the device tree.  The way this is
specified in the device tree is still under discussion.

The Apple hardware advertises support for 8 GT/s, but all the devices
integrated on the Mac mini support only 2.5 GT/s or 5 GT/s.

Hope this helps,
