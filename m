Generally, I don't object the cleanup patches since the code looks more 
cleaner.
But my concern is that since some additional function calls are added to 
hot path
(raid5_make_request), could the performance be affected?

And I think patch 9 and patch 12 are helpful for performance 
improvement,Â  did
you measure the performance without those cleanup patches?

Thanks,
Guoqing
