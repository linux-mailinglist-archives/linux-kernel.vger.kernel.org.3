Thanks for the explanation and suggestions, I totally agree with you that
applications SHOULD be calling fsync() before an overwriting rename() and
the filesystem just do best efforts.

For the above "with auto_da_alloc and no dioread_nolock" case, I'm not sure
I understand right, please correct me if I say wrong. With auto_da_alloc,
data=ordered and no dioread_nolock, it separates into two cases: 1) the new
written contents was appended to an allocated block; 2) the new contents
was written to a new block.

For case 1, we have a few hundred milliseconds window as you said,
because the inode will not be added to transaction->t_inode_list, so
the transaction committing progress does not wait data blocks to
write to complete. For case 2, the inode will be added to
transaction->t_inode_list, we can guarantee that data write to disk
before the rename() completes, so there is no window for this case.

Thanks,
Yi.
