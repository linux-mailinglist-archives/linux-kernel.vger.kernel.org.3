Thanks Peter for explaining the GCE approach.  If I understand correctly,
if the hypervisor is malicious, it could lie to the vTPM and set those
"few bits" so it'll look like the VM is running with SEV enabled (whereas
in fact it is running without memory encryption).  But that's outside the
scope, right?

We rely on the OvmfPkg/AmdSev build of OVMF, which is a stripped down
firmware that can boot only in one of two ways:

a. direct boot to kernel/initrd/cmdline whose hashes are included in
   the LAUNCH_MEASURE data (see [1], [2], [3]).
b. boot to embedded grub (in OVMF) which decrypts an encrypted boot drive
   using a secret from LAUNCH_SECRET (see [4] and [5]).

For the current series (efi_secret kernel module), method (a) is the relevant
one.  The Cloud Provider boots a guest VM with OVMF, and -kernel/-initrd/-append. The
content of OVMF and the hashes of kernel/initrd/cmdline are measured in LAUNCH_MEASURE
and sent to the Guest Owner (=Customer).  If they match, the Guest Owner should perform 
a LAUNCH_SECRET and inject the secret to a designated SEV launch secrets page.  

Then the guest starts running; when the kernel starts the EFI driver saves the address
of this page (patch 1), and later exposes the secrets in this page as files in
securityfs (patch 3). The secrets can be used by the guest workload in whatever way
it needs (examples discussed above: ssh private key; API key to obtain secrets;
decryption key for some encrypted files; ...). 

Any attempt of a malicious cloud provider to modify OVMF, kernel, initrd, or cmdline
will cause the SEV measurement to be wrong. 

Note again that the proposed kernel patch series has nothing to do with the measurement
sequence -- it assumes the secrets page is already populated, and exposes it
to userspace as files.

Hope this explains our approach.
