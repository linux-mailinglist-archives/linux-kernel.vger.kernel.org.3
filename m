The basic architecture isn't gonna change and there are fundamental reasons
why things are the way they are. The resources, especially the main ones,
are entangled with each other - e.g. memory, io and cpu are entangled with
each other through reclaim. While we aren't capturing the cpu part yet but
we now do a largely acceptable job of controlling memory and io together.

This is reduction of flexibility compared to cgroup1 and can cause some
inconvenience when transitioning from cgroup1 but the experience has been
that the pros clearly outweigh the cons. Even here, none of the problems
you're listing are architectural. If there are memcg behavior problems, we
should fix them in memcg, not work around by twisting the basic
architecture. Are the problematic memcg behaviors reproducible in upstream?
If so, can you please make a detailed report on those?

Thanks.
