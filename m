Hi Madhaven,

I'm concerning that depending on compilers to generate correct 
information can become a trouble because we linux kernel side can rarely 
fix what compilers make. That's also why the gcc plugin idea was 
objected in the objtool migration.

If your parser can solve this it sounds more doable.

I'm wondering how much functions will give a unreliable result because 
any unreliable function shows in stack trace will cause livepatch 
fail/retry. IIUC all unmarked assembly functions will considered 
unreliable and cause problem. It can be a burden to mark all of them.

My support reason for FP with validation is that it provides a guarantee 
for FP unwinder. FP and ORC use absolute and relative for stack unwind 
to unwind stack respectively, however FP has been considered unreliable. 
Is there any feature depends on FP? If so it can be more persuasive.


Also this patch is much more completed than migration for objtool. It 
would be nice if this could be put into use quickly. The objtool-arm64 
is less than half done, but I'm going to relies as much as possible on 
current objtool components, so no more feasibility validation is required.

By the way, I was thinking about a corner case, because arm64 CALL 
instruction won't push LR onto stack atomically as x86. Before push LR, 
FP to save frame there still can be some instructions such as bti, 
paciasp. If an irq happens here, the stack frame is not constructed so 
the FP unwinder will omit this function and provides a wrong stack trace 
to livepatch.

It's just a guess and I have not built the test case. But I think it's a 
defect on arm64 that FP unwinder can't work properly on prologue and 
epilogue. Do you have any idea about this?

Thanks for your time,
Chen
