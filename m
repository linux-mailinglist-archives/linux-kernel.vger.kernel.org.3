I NEED TRUST.

Hope you are in good health with your family.

I am Mr.Komi Zongo.  I work as the Foreign Operations Manager with
one of the international banks here in Burkina Faso. Although the
world is a very small place and hard place to meet people because you
don't know who to trust or believe, as I have developed trust in you
after my fasting and praying,  I made up my mind to confide this
confidential business suggestion to you.

There is an overdue unclaimed sum of Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars ($10,500,000.00) in my bank, belonging to one of
our dead foreign customers. There were no beneficiaries stated
concerning these funds. Therefore, your request as a foreigner is
necessary to apply for the claim and release of the fund smoothly into
your reliable bank account  as the Foreign Business Partner to the
deceased.

On the transfer of this fund in your account, you will take 40% as
your share from the total fund, 5% will be shared to Charitable
Organizations while Motherless Babies homes, disabled helpless as the
balance of 55% will be for me. If you are really sure of your
integrity, trustworthy, and confidentiality, reply urgently and to
prove that, include your particulars as follows.

Please get back to me through this Email Address komizongo2020@gmail.com

please fill in your personal information as indicated below and as
soon as i receive this information below i will forward you a text of an
application which you will fill and send to the bank for the claim of the
fund as i will direct you on what to do.
