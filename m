Hi Pali,

Thank you for reaching me out. I hope I can help.
I don't work directly over Armada A3720 nor knowing anyone from team.
Unfortunately, this means I have no access to the data/code you are
looking for. Nevertheless, I have escalated this problem internally.
I believe this should help to get to right people which can investigate
patch/issue and do actual work.

Kind regards,
Wojciech.
