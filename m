The spec says "this bit indicates the DOE instance has a *data object*
available to be read by system firmware/software".

So, the entire object is available for reading, not just one dword.

You've already got checks in place for the first two dwords which
cover reading an "all zeroes" response.  No need to amend them.

You only need to re-check the Data Object Ready bit on the last-but-one
dword in case the function was reset concurrently.  Per sec. 6.30.2,
"An FLR to a Function must result in the aborting of any DOE transfer
in progress."

Right, I was mistaken, sorry for the noise.

That however looks wrong because the DOE Interrupt Status bit is never
cleared after a DOE Error is signaled.  The state machine performs an
explicit abort upon an error by setting the DOE Abort bit, but that
doesn't seem to clear DOE Interrupt Status:

Per section 6.30.2, "At any time, the system firmware/software is
permitted to set the DOE Abort bit in the DOE Control Register,
and the DOE instance must Clear the Data Object Ready bit,
if not already Clear, and Clear the DOE Error bit, if already Set,
in the DOE Status Register, within 1 second."

No mention of the DOE Interrupt Status bit, so we cannot assume that
it's cleared by a DOE Abort and we must clear it explicitly.

Thanks,
