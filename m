That's fair.  I suggest "bt1_pcie_ops" or "bt1_dw_pcie_ops" to match
the other drivers that include the driver name:

  intel_pcie_ops
  keembay_pcie_ops
  kirin_dw_pcie_ops
  tegra_dw_pcie_ops

They're not 100% consistent, but hopefully we can at least not make
things *less* consistent.

Yes.  I don't think there's value in names being gratuitously
different.

I'd like the usage across drivers to be consistent unless there's a
hardware difference that requires something different.  So if you can
point to something different in bt1, great.  If not, do it the same as
the other drivers.

Do any other drivers contain similar logic?  If so, please use a
similar name.

BTW, the comment says "de-assert" but the code looks like "assert".

Even if they are used only once, it's helpful when constants like this
can be connected to the spec or other justification for the specific
values.

There's definitely some tension between making one driver better and
making it different from all the others.  I'm all in favor of making
all the drivers better and more consistent.  I'm less in favor of
one-off improvements because consistency is extremely important for
maintenance.

I stand corrected.  Of the 21 dw_pcie_host_init() calls, 13 are from
*_pcie_probe(), 7 are from *_add_pcie_port(), and tegra is from
tegra_pcie_init_controller().  I think the *_add_pcie_port() structure
is better because it makes room to support multiple root ports.

Let's add a comment about the fact that this is needed because of the
eDMA engine.

I agree with your rationale.  Intel and kirin do:

  *_pcie_probe
    dw_pcie_host_init

  *_pcie_remove
    dw_pcie_host_deinit

and tegra is similar but from tegra_pcie_init_controller() and
tegra_pcie_deinit_controller().  Exynos is the odd one out and calls
dw_pcie_host_init() from exynos_add_pcie_port() but
dw_pcie_host_deinit() from exynos_pcie_remove().

Your model is better since it removes the "single root port"
assumption.  I would like the "bt1_pcie_add_port()" and
"bt1_pcie_del_port()" (or "bt1_pcie_remove_port()", which would be
slightly more parallel with "add") names to align with other drivers.
