help
  Keys may be added to the IMA or IMA blacklist keyrings, if the
  key is validly signed by a CA cert in the system built-in or
  secondary trusted keyrings.

  Intermediate keys between those the kernel has compiled in and the 
  IMA keys to be added may be added to the system secondary keyring,
  provided they are validly signed by a key already resident in the
  built-in or secondary trusted keyrings.


The first paragraph requires "validly signed by a CA cert in the system
built-in or secondary trusted keyrings" for keys to be loaded onto the
IMA keyring.  This Kconfig is limited to just the builtin and secondary
keyrings.  Changing this silently to include the ".machine" keyring
introduces integrity risks that previously did not exist.  A new IMA
Kconfig needs to be defined to allow all three keyrings - builtin,
machine, and secondary.

The second paragraph implies that only CA and intermediate CA keys are
on secondary keyring, or as in our case the ".machine" keyring linked
to the secondary keyring.
