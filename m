As mentioned in the cover letter response, it just seems best to keep 
the normal scsi_cmnd payload but have other means to add on the internal 
command data, like using host_scribble or scsi_cmnd priv data.

I don't know, let me think about it. Maybe we could add an "internal" 
blk flag, which uses a separate "internal" queue_rq callback.
