So technically you're right that we should hold buffer lock all the time
from before we modify superblock buffer until we recompute the checksum (so
that we avoid writing superblock with mismatched checksum). To do this we'd
have to put checksum recomputations and superblock buffer locking into
ext4_orphan_cleanup() around setting of es->s_last_orphan (in three places
there AFAICS). A bit tedious but it would actually also fix a (theoretical)
race that someone decides to write out superblock after we set
s_last_orphan but before we set the checksum.

Overall I'm not convinced this is really necessary so I'd be OK even with
what Ye suggested. That is IMHO better than mostly pointless locking just
around checksum computation because that just makes reader wonder why is it
needed...
