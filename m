I don't understand what's going on here.  Do we understand the AER
message flood?  Are we just papering over it by disabling AER?

If an error occurs below a VMD, who notices and reports it?  If we
disable native AER below VMD because of _OSC, as this patch does, I
guess we're assuming the platform will handle AER events below VMD.
Is that really true?  Does the platform know how to find AER log
registers of devices below VMD?
