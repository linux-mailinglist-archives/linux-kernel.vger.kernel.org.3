But still, you're asking users to install an extra thing in the boot
chain. That's what I mean by "special". So the situation would then be
this: User needs a) GRUB (or something similar) for booting the kernel
(or dual-booting, ...), b) DTBLoader for loading the device-tree because
we don't support the ACPI Qualcomm provided, and c) your thing for EFI
variables and potentially other firmware fix-ups. b) and c) are both
things that "normal" users don't expect. IMHO we should try to get rid
of those "non-standard" things, not add more.

Sure, but is making the Linux installation process more device
dependent and complicated really the best way to solve this?
