Yes. There is actual problems at the data production end of the 
pipeline. Let me just focus on one of the type of examples. The Check 
TID examples look for some thread data for each thread that runs in the 
sample. If they do not get at least one such context id that matches a 
thread ID (as that is what the contextid does map to) then it will fail. 
  We're missing that. It's not reliable. The tests show this. They don't 
fix it, but the point of these tests is to find issues so we know what 
issues exist before any data is decoded.

In my new patch set I've removed a lot of the tests and kept only a 
smaller set. In my tests it now takes about 3-8 mins to run instead of 
about 1 min (It's variable because the amount of data collected can be 
highly variable and 99% of the time in these tests is spend dumping the 
perf data to see what is in there and this is time consuming. If the 
test produces 2x the data vs last run it takes a lot longer to dump and 
this actually happens).

Unfortunately I can't get it down to that. As above. The TID tests are 
fairly short but sometimes produce 20m perf data files, sometimes 80m 
sometimes 130m... it's indeterminate even if the actual test itself is 
constant (runs the same identical workload). I can cut down the number 
of tests and squeeze down the loop runs etc. which I have now done, but 
we still have the above problem.

It's a more "extensible harness" to just drop many varieties of tests 
into - e.g. the TID example s- do we collect thread data from every 
thread? They also store "quality" of data over time in CSV files. You 
can clearly see the high variability coming out of the tests there. They 
include actual test tools/source (don't just run some existing binary 
like touch) thus control what is being recorded. I built them to be 
easily expanded over time with more specific case tests by just dropping 
in a new directory with a new tool and.or a new script in the tests dir 
to use that tool or an existing one and re-use shared functions etc.

And yes - it tests only userspace (for now). Rome was not built in a 
day. It's testing userspace as that is what is being controlled (by the 
test tools). Tracing kernel code is another problem and thing to test. I 
was hoping this is a start and that's why it's built as a more extensive 
harness to be re-used and expanded on.

Different workloads. Provide something that should have a large amount 
of instructions to trace across lots of memory as opposed to small tight 
loops. What do we collect then? Do we collect data across multiple 
threads? If we keep every core busy, then what? Due to the way data is 
collected (buffers/interrupts), it's a lossy exercise and Having 
different workloads to see where we might not collect as much data as 
we'd like is useful. That's why there are multiple tests.

Those were existing tests being used in test_etm (out of kernel tree) 
already so I put them in as they were seemingly good enough there so 
perf test would become a superset of the above and add more.

The runtime is almost entirely due to perf dump. I spent a little time 
profiling perf dump and didn't see any obvious hotspots to quickly pick 
low hanging fruit from.

Think of it measuring the body - seeing some amount as opposed to none 
or only 1 ... yes- this is measuring the compressed encoding but it's 
one of the very common ones so it was a quick way to do this as opposed 
to completely decoding the data and then checking that (which would be 
more costly and make tests take longer). I did have high-ish numbers but 
they were actually a result of going "well on most runs we tend to get X 
in real life so if we get X/10 we should have enough". Yes - 1 or 2 or 
10 could also be sensible as it is lossy and we should collect SOME 
data, but preferably we should be collecting more. If we would not have 
a lossy process that collected everything we should get a stable amount 
of data collected... that would be the goal eventually.

That's actually the point. Imagine someone makes a change in the driver 
that now loses 60% of the trace data. If we just assume any amount of 
loss is just fine - we'd never know unless we have tests measuring this 
until eventually some time later someone wonders why their profile data 
is so variable... this is exactly why the tests store the data they 
collect over time in csv files so you can see trends or points where 
suddenly data took a hit or jumped up to collect more.

That would be more expensive to do (and make the tests take longer) 
which goes against some of your desires above. This would be another 
stage in the tests beyond what they do (Rome was not built in a day :)). 
Coverage would then tell us if we cover the function at least once. How 
many times do we cover it? If it runs 10000 times do we get trace data 
for all of its 10000 executions? or only 100 of them? or 10? or 1? This 
is certainly much more involved and an evolution of tests to do more. 
I'm not sure I should sit and make the test do everything possible and 
test everything from day 1. Start with a base that is intended to expand 
cleanly and in a "modular" way and then build from there. I've learned 
over the years to always build things in steps and get your groundwork 
good before going the next step. I'm doing this here. Groundwork with 
some exercising of it.

100% correct. Or more looking at what comes out of the kernel perf 
driver into perf data files. It's focusing on this part of the pipeline 
- not the "decode that data and do something useful with it" part. I 
specifically focused on this part as this is a source of data loss and 
quality of data. You can have the best decoding on the planet - if your 
input data is poor ... you will have poor results. I also understood 
that you were working on the other end of the pipeline (the decode/do 
something with it end) and thus thought I'd fill in the part you were 
not working on rather than conflict with the stuff you are doing.

Then then we would have our tests fragmented. Testing kernel output 
won't have tests in the kernel tree for the data/subsystem that is 
reading/collecting/writinf that data...

Done. Patches coming.

Done mostly as above (except the TID test where I'm down to 2 tests).

>   * Only one test for each thing/failure mode

Done - mostly, as above.

>   * Much less overlapping test code (for example F3 atoms only need to be counted for one test, not all of them)

It's measuring if we have test "body". I could do this in more expensive 
ways in addition to the metadata blocks (async and trace info).

>   * Concrete descriptions of failure modes and what each test is looking for

I haven't done this yet - let me send a new patch set which is smaller 
and we'll go from there.

>   * Small magic numbers which are easy to justify (like "samples < 1, check for complete loss of data")

Done.

>   * Run through the full Perf pipeline and look at the synthesised samples rather than raw trace

I thought you were dealing with this end?

>   * Some thought about how this fits in with test_arm_coresight.sh

As above - more of an extended harness to add to over time rather than a 
single test that fails or succeeds - its broken down into many tests so 
you know which succeed or fail. I've dealt with tests units that merge 
dozens or even 100+ tests into a single case and then just report fail 
or succeed and it's very annoying as you don't get an isolated result to 
tell you what you broke. If this single shell script keeps getting more 
and more things to test then .. which one broke when all you see is a 
single fail? It's a time sink to go digging every time. Broken cleanly 
into multiple tests is far better.

>> +    Coresight / Memcpy 1M 25 Threads
>> +    Coresight / Unroll Loop Thread 2
>> +    ...

>> +
>> +These tests will log historical results in the current working
>> +directory (e.g. tools/perf) and will be named stats-*.csv like:
>> +
>> +    stats-asm_pure_loop-out.csv
>> +    stats-bubble_sort-random.csv
>> +    ...
>> +
>> +These statistic files log some aspects of the AUX data sections in
>> +the perf data output counting some numbers of certain encodings (a
>> +good way to know that it's working in a very simple way). One problem
>> +with coresight is that given a large enough amount of data needing to
>> +be logged, some of it can be lost due to the processor not waking up
>> +in time to read out all the data from buffers etc.. You will notice
>> +that the amount of data collected can vary a lot per run of perf test.
>> +If you wish to see how this changes over time, simply run perf test
>> +multiple times and all these csv files will have more and more data
>> +appended to it that you can later examine, graph and otherwise use to
>> +figure out if things have become worse or better.
>> +
>> +Be aware that amny of these tests take quite a while to run, specifically
>> +in processing the perf data file and dumping contents to then examine what
>> +is inside.
>> +
>> +You can change where these csv logs are stored by setting the
>> +PERF_TEST_CORESIGHT_STATDIR environment variable before running perf
>> +test like:
>> +
>> +    export PERF_TEST_CORESIGHT_STATDIR=/var/tmp
>> +    perf test
>> +
>> +They will also store resulting perf output data in the current
>> +directory for later inspection like:
>> +
>> +    perf-memcpy-1m.data
>> +    perf-thread_loop-2th.data
>> +    ...
>> +
>> +You can alter where the perf data files are stored by setting the
>> +PERF_TEST_CORESIGHT_DATADIR environment variable such as:
>> +
>> +    PERF_TEST_CORESIGHT_DATADIR=/var/tmp
>> +    perf test
>> +
>> +You may wish to set these above environment variables if you which to
>> +keep the output of tests outside of the current working directory for
>> +longer term storage and examination.
