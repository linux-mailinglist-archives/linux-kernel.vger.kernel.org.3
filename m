Thomas Gleixner has been working on dynamic allocation of MSI-X vectors.
We should probably just build on that and let the PCI core allocate
vectors for DOE mailboxes independently from drivers.

To conserve vectors, I'd delay allocation for a DOE mailbox until
it is first used.  There may be mailboxes that are never used.

DOE requires MSI-X or MSI.  We could probably leave MSI unsupported
until a device with broken MSI-X support shows up.  I envision that
with MSI, the onus is on the driver to allocate vectors for mailboxes
it intends to use and it would then have to "donate" those vectors
to the PCI core via a library function.

As for portdrv, that's a driver but Bjorn has expressed a desire
for a long time to move its functionality into the PCI core.
It shouldn't be allowed to unbind portdrv via sysfs and thus break
DPC etc, as is currently possible.

The question with regards to this series is, do we get *something*
merged and perfect it over time once it's in the tree, or do we
keep iterating on the mailing list.  I deliberately only provided
a single, comprehensive review and then stayed mum because I feel
bad for Ira having to keep reacting to more and more feedback
despite being at v11 already (or v12?  I've lost count).
Particularly because I suspect (I might be mistaken) that Ira's
natural habitat is actually CXL not PCI, so it might be a burden for him.
I'd be fine to implement suggestions I've made myself after Ira's
series lands.  No need for him to keep iterating ad infinitum.

Thanks,

Lukas
