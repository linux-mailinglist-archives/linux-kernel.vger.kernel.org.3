Yes, and that is a problem. Because all the places checking for
ext4_has_inline_data() would have to be protected by xattr_sem (unless they
are already protected by i_rwsem) to make sure we cannot race with inline
data creation which is just unworkable both for performance and I suspect
also lock ordering reasons.

I don't think the switch to ext4_iomap_report_ops is really correct. We
use ext4_iomap_ops mostly for direct IO and if inline data gets there,
there's indeed a deeper problem. Specifically for ext4_bmap() using i_rwsem
may be acceptable solution but I'm generally against sprinkling locks here
and there without good general locking design how exactly are inline data
operations intended to be synchronized with stuff as writeback, readahead
etc. Because as I wrote above xattr_sem is not really a working answer...
