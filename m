Remind me what contradictions you see?  I know Kenny saw NVMe errors
on a kernel that included 4257f7e008ea ("PCI/ASPM: Save/restore L1SS
Capability for suspend/resume") in December 2020 [1], and that he did
*not* see those errors on 4257f7e008ea in February 2022 [2].  Is that
what you mean?

I assume you refer to [2], where on 4257f7e008ea ("PCI/ASPM:
Save/restore L1SS Capability for suspend/resume"), Kenny saw ASPM L1
disabled before hibernate and enabled afterwards:

  --- pre-hibernate
  +++ post-hibernate
    00:1d.7 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel [8086:34b7]
      Bus: primary=00, secondary=58, subordinate=58
	LnkCtl: ASPM Disabled; RCB 64 bytes, Disabled- CommClk+
    58:00.0 RTS525A PCI Express Card Reader [10ec:525a]
  -     LnkCtl: ASPM Disabled; RCB 64 bytes, Disabled- CommClk-
  -             ExtSynch- ClockPM- AutWidDis- BWInt- AutBWInt-
  +     LnkCtl: ASPM L1 Enabled; RCB 64 bytes, Disabled- CommClk-
  +             ExtSynch- ClockPM+ AutWidDis- BWInt- AutBWInt-

Per PCIe r6.0, sec 7.5.3.7, "ASPM L1 must be enabled by software in
the Upstream component on a Link prior to enabling ASPM L1 in the
Downstream component on that Link," so this definitely seems broken,
but wouldn't explain the NVMe issue.

The PCI core (pcie_config_aspm_link()) always enables L1 in the
upstream component before the downstream one, but 58:00.0 uses the
rtsx_pci driver, which does a lot of its own ASPM fiddling, so my
guess is that it's doing something wrong here.

I don't know which report this refers to.

I agree that a BIOS change between [1] and [2] seems plausible, but I
don't think we can prove that yet.  I'm slightly queasy because while
Kenny may have updated his BIOS, most people will not have.

I think we should try this patch again with some changes and maybe
some debug logging:

  - I wonder if we should integrate the LTR, L1 SS, and Link Control
    ASPM restore instead of having them spread around through
    pci_restore_ltr_state(), pci_restore_aspm_l1ss_state(), and
    pci_restore_pcie_state().  Maybe a new pci_restore_aspm() that
    would be called from pci_restore_pcie_state()?

  - For L1 PM Substates configuration, sec 5.5.4 says that both ports
    must be configured while ASPM L1 is disabled, but I don't think we
    currently guarantee this: we restore all the upstream component
    state first, and we don't know the ASPM state of the downstream
    one.  Maybe we need to:

      * When restoring upstream component,
          + disable its ASPM

      * When restoring downstream component,
          + disable its ASPM
	  + restore upstream component's LTR, L1SS
	  + restore downstream component's LTR, L1SS
	  + restore upstream component's ASPM
	  + restore downstream component's ASPM

      This seems pretty messy, but seems like what the spec requires.

    - Add some pci_dbg() logging of all these save/restore values to
      help debug any issues.
