This is exactly what we see. It's not all machines, but in our lab we've seen in
it on 3 production systems out of about 20. And they were all different
generations, a 7th, 8th, and 10th gen.

nvme_suspend is relying on NVMe APST / PCIe ASPM to put the device in a low
power state. The link state will be L1 or deeper while the device remains in D0.

We will look at this.
