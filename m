No worries, thank you so much for taking the time to review.

That is correct.

The TrenchBoot model is a bit different and takes a more flexible
approach to allow users to build tailored solutions. For instance Secure
Launch is able to be used in a configuration that is similar to tboot.
Consider the functions of tboot, it has a portion that is the
post-launch kernel that handles the handover from the ACM and a portion
that provides the Verified Launch policy engine, which is only capable
of enforcing policy on what is contained in the Multiboot chain. The
TrenchBoot approach is to introduce the Secure Launch capability into a
kernel, in this case Linux, to handle the handover from the ACM, and
then transition to a running user space that can contain a distribution
specific policy enforcement. As an example, the TrenchBoot project
contributed to the uroot project a Secure Launch policy engine which
enables the creation of an initramfs image which can then be embedded
into a minimal configuration Secure Launch Linux kernel. This results in
a single binary that functions like tboot but with a far richer and more
extensible policy engine.

With regard to TXT's Launch Control Policy, it is a function of SINIT
ACM and so it is still very much possible to be used with Secure Launch.
In fact such a configuration has been tested and used. Now it is out of
scope in the sense that the tboot project already maintains and provides
the lcptools suite for managing LCPs. If there is a requirement to use
an LCP, then the lcptools can be used to create a policy to only allow
the specific instance(s) of a Secure Launch kernel.

If TXT is launched in Legacy PCR usage mode, then the bzImage, as loaded
into memory by the bootloader (GRUB), will be hashed into PCR 18. If it
is launched in the default Details and Authorities (DA) PCR usage mode,
then the bzImage will be hashed into PCR 17. This is because the kernel
has been promoted to being the MLE.

Revisiting the tboot-like configuration: the Secure Launch kernel, its
configuration (cmdline), and uroot initramfs (which may be embedded or
separate) are all part of the MLE started by the ACM. For tboot there is
the tboot binary and the VL policy, though uncertain if it was
configurable where the policy hash would be extended. Like the tboot VL
policy engine, the u-root policy engine is configurable where the
measurements are stored.

As highlighted, more components are measured as part of Secure Launch
than for tboot. The approach taken was to model after DA and put
binaries into 17 and configuration into 18. Later there were
requirements to isolate certain measurements. For the time this is
provided through kconfig to move config to 19 and initrd to 20. In the
future if/when additional measurements are incorporated, such as signing
keys that are embedded into the kernel, then it may be necessary to
provide a means to configure PCR usage at runtime.

Without rehashing the issues around TPM usage from the stub, the core
issue is that measurements need to be collected before usage which is at
a time when access to the TPM is not possible at this time. Thus the
measurements need to be collected and persisted in a location where they
can be retrieved when the main kernel is in control. It was felt using
the DRTM TPM log was a natural place as it persists all the info
necessary to record the measurements by the SL platform module. Though
it does result in there being two non-event entries to exist in the log
but those are standardized such that any TCG compliant log parser should
ignore them.

With the explanation of why it was done aside, if there is another
location that is preferred which can provide the necessary guarantees,
then there is no reason why they could not be switched to that location.

Correct, relaunch is not currently implemented but has always been
planned as relaunch enables DRTM late-launch use cases. For a few
reasons this is being elevated in priority and as a result there is a
short-term solution to quickly enable relaunch with longer term direct
integration into kexec.

Finally if your schedule allows it and it is not too much to ask, it
would be greatly appreciated if some code review could be provided.
Otherwise thank you for taking the time that you have to review the
approach.
