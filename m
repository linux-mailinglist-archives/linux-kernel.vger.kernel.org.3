 This specific pointer refers to the BIOS area being iterated over:

	for (addr = (u8 *)__va(0xf0000);
	     addr < (u8 *)__va(0x100000);
	     addr++) {

and it is conceptually not new code in that a similar piece as below:

	for (addr = (u8 *)__va(0xf0000);
	     addr < (u8 *)__va(0x100000);
	     addr += 16) {

used to be there before my change and even now it is executed earlier on 
in `pirq_find_routing_table'.

 Thank you for your report and apologies for the trouble.

 I don't know what a "ChromiumOS crosvm" is, but the mention of "Chromium" 
indicates to me it is something reasonably recent that should be using 
ACPI rather than legacy PCI IRQ routing, and even then it should be using 
the standardised $PIR format rather than AMI's proprietary $IRT one.  I am 
more than surprised this code is active for x86-64 even, as this is solely 
i386 legacy.

 In any case we need to debug this and possibly work around somehow as 
this BIOS is likely giving us rubbish information.  Unfortunately without 
access to your Linux build tree along with debug information I can do very 
little.  The faulting piece of code is as follows:

  21:	48 83 c0 01          	add    $0x1,%rax
  25:	48 39 d0             	cmp    %rdx,%rax
  28:	74 55                	je     7f <foo+0x7f>
  2a:	80 38 00             	cmpb   $0x0,(%rax)
  2d:	74 f2                	je     21 <foo+0x21>

-- with the CMPB at 2a being the offender and further information required 
as to what RAX holds at the moment.

 So as the first approximation I would like to see what your BIOS actually 
tells Linux.  Would you therefore please try the following debug patch, 
boot with the `debug' kernel parameter and send me the resulting bootstrap 
log?

  Maciej
