I would like to quote the comments from google side for more details
which can also be observed from different vendors.
"Also be advised that when you enable memcg v2 you will be using
per-app memcg configuration which implies noticeable overhead because
every app will have its own group. For example pagefault path will
regress by about 15%. And obviously there will be some memory overhead
as well. That's the reason we don't enable them in Android by
default."

Correct, this is just our confusion. Besides, we believe that charge
the pages to implicit memory enabled parent control group doesn't make
sense as the memory cannot be managed at all.
