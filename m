Could we align to the semantic of /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.swappiness?
Some distributions like Ubuntu is still using cgroup v1.

For micro-service architecture, the application in one container is not a
set of loosely tight processes, it's aim at provide one certain service,
so different containers means different service, and different service
has different QoS demand. 

The reason why we need per-group(per-container) setting is because most
container are managed by compose software, the compose software provide
UI to decide how to run a container(likes setting swappiness value). For
example the docker compose:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command

To make it clearer, I try to make a summary for why container needs this patch:
    1.one machine can run different containers;
    2.for some scenario, container runs only one service inside(can be only one
application);
    3.different containers provide different services, different services have
different QoS demands;
    4.THP has big influence on QoS. It's fast for memory access, but eat more
memory;
    5.containers usually managed by compose software, which treats container as
base management unit;
    6.this patch provide cgroup THP controller, which can be a method to adjust
container memory QoS.
