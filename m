Could you please explain what exactly are we leaking?

I do not see anything allocated in klp_init_*_early() functions.
Also I do not see anything allocated in kobject_init().

Documentation/core-api/kobject.rst says that kobject_put() must be
used after calling kobject_add():

   "Once you registered your kobject via kobject_add(), you must never use
    kfree() to free it directly. The only safe way is to use kobject_put(). It
    is good practice to always use kobject_put() after kobject_init() to avoid
    errors creeping in."


Hmm, the comment in lib/kobject.c says something else:

/**
 * kobject_init() - Initialize a kobject structure.
 * @kobj: pointer to the kobject to initialize
 * @ktype: pointer to the ktype for this kobject.
 *
 * This function will properly initialize a kobject such that it can then
 * be passed to the kobject_add() call.
 *
 * After this function is called, the kobject MUST be cleaned up by a call
 * to kobject_put(), not by a call to kfree directly to ensure that all of
 * the memory is cleaned up properly.
 */

I believe that this comment is misleading. IMHO, kobject_init() allows
to call kobject_put(). And it might be used to free memory that has
already been allocated when initializing the structure where this
kobject is bundled. But simple free() is perfectly fine when nothing
else was allocated.

Adding Greg into Cc.
