Got it. Thanks for clarification. So far I has been sure that re-using
the locally implemented specifics was more preferable. It was so
obvious for me that I missed there can be the PCI common code requirements.
Though it would be nice to have it described somewhere in the kernel
docs.

Oh, I didn't know about them. Thanks for pointing out on those
methods. I'll use them in my driver then.

It seems to me my driver will be another special case. But instead of
re-implementing the pci_ops.{read,write} accessors it will use the
dword-aligned generic config read/write functions.
