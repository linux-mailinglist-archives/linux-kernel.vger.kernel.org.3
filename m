The stats table is bogus. As soon as the combination of the states leads 
to a size greater than a page size, then the result is truncated.

As the cooling devices is also abused to mimic power capping capable 
device, we are ending up to 1024 states sometimes.

Moreover, having the option set also create tables which take MB of 
memory for nothing.

The option only enables the stats for all the cooling device stats.

As you mentioned, it seems to you are using the stats for debugging 
purpose. The debugfs provides the same information, except it does only 
show the transitions would actually happened and we are no longer 
limited to a page size.

Would it be acceptable to remove the sysfs stats ?
