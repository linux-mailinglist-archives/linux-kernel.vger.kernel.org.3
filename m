Hello Krzysztof,

Thanks for your suggestion.
I have discussed with Jia-wei internally.
We want to push next version because we finish to prepare the driver
parts.

For binding part, we want to cancel the transformation to yaml first
and only add the mediatek cci property for cpufreq series in next
version.

I will help Jia-wei to push next version.
If you have any suggestion, we can discuss in the next version (v2) of
this series.

Thanks for your big support!

BRs,
Rex
