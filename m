Hum, for me all emails from Huawei I've received even today fail the DKIM
check. After some more digging there is interesting inconsistency in DMARC
configuration for huawei.com domain. There is DMARC record for huawei.com
like:

huawei.com.		600	IN	TXT	"v=DMARC1;p=none;rua=mailto:dmarc@edm.huawei.com"

which means no DKIM is required but _dmarc.huawei.com has:

_dmarc.huawei.com.	600	IN	TXT	"v=DMARC1;p=quarantine;ruf=mailto:dmarc@huawei.com;rua=mailto:dmarc@huawei.com"

which says that DKIM is required. I guess this inconsistency may be the
reason why there are problems with DKIM validation for senders from
huawei.com. Yu Kuai, can you perhaps take this to your IT support to fix
this? Either make sure huawei.com emails get properly signed with DKIM or
remove the 'quarantine' record from _dmarc.huawei.com. Thanks!
