Yeah, this fix is still needed for other regular file's journalled data when we
mounted filesystem with data=jouranl mode. But if we just consider whether if we
could unify the journal mode of ext4's metadata blocks, it seems that using
data=journal mode for symlink's external data block is also complicated and
confused in the creating procedure. Instead, if we use ext4_bread(), it make
things clear, and it seems also has no side effect of reading symlinks. I write
a RFC patch to do this, please take a look at my latest mail "[RFC PATCH] ext4:
convert symlink external data block mapping to bdev".

Thanks,
Yi.
