What you propose makes sense to me. But the lack of testing is troublesome.
You can always at least test your patch without highmem on isofs image with
compression (mkisofs seems to support creating such filesystems). Even that
would detect a bug in your patch ;) - see below.

This is wrong. Most importantly because you need to add 'poffset' to the
final address provided by kmap_local_page(), not to the struct page pointer.

Secondly please wrap the line to fit into 80 chars.

This looks buggy as well. If we mapped page above, we'll unmap it here even
if stream.avail_out > 0 and we want to still write to it. I think you
should unmap the page here only if stream.avail_out == 0 and we are going
to switch to the next page...

This is correct but I'd simplify it to:

	if (stream.next_out && stream.next_out != (char *)zisofs_sink_page)
		kunmap_local(stream.next_out);
