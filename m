Then please explain it in detail and in the text so that it is clear. As
it is now, the reader is left wondering what that file is supposed to
state.

So this would mean that if a system doesn't have CXL devices and has
TME/SME/SEV-* enabled, then it is running with encrypted memory.

Which would then also mean, you don't need any of that code - you only
need to enumerate CXL devices which, it seems, do not support memory
encryption, and then state that memory encryption is enabled on the
whole system, except for the memory of those devices.

I.e.,

$ dmesg | grep -i SME
[    1.783650] AMD Memory Encryption Features active: SME

Done - memory is encrypted on the whole system.

We could export it into /proc/cpuinfo so that you don't have to grep
dmesg and problem solved.
