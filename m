Ok so `git blame` shows that Kent added this to md/raid5.c in 
c78afc6261b (Kent Overstreet 2013-07-11 22:39:53 -0700 7526)
	mddev->queue->limits.raid_partial_stripes_expensive = 1;

    bcache/md: Use raid stripe size
    
    Now that we've got code for raid5/6 stripe awareness, bcache just needs
    to know about the stripes and when writing partial stripes is expensive
    - we probably don't want to enable this optimization for raid1 or 10,
    even though they have stripes. So add a flag to queue_limits.

Kent, Martin:

Do you think we should leave the md-specific 
raid_partial_stripes_expensive setting and require users of RAID 
controllers to set the bit themselves in bcache---or---remove all 
raid_partial_stripes_expensive code and always treat writes as "expensive" 
when `opt_io` is defined?
