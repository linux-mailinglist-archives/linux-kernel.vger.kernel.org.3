Meaning c7a75d07827a didn't matter for you. I'm not sure that it would.

Can you tell me what 'dma-ranges' contains on your system?

How is Dann changing it then? I assume he's not changing the firmware,
but overriding it. That could be a possible solution.

Do the DT's in the kernel tree correspond to anything anyone is using?
I ask because at some point someone will need to address all the
warnings they have or we should drop the dts files if they aren't
close to reality. The same thing applies to Seattle BTW.

I wasn't really suggesting breaking things on purpose. However, there
is a cost to keeping code and it would be nice to know what's being
used or not. The cost isn't *that* big, but it is not zero for what's
not many users.

At least for St=C3=A9phane, using ACPI didn't even work. I'm assuming there
is some version of h/w and f/w out there that did work with the ACPI
support in the kernel? That may have never been seen by anyone but APM
and Jon Masters (his Tested-by is on the patch from APM adding ACPI
support). It's not hard to imagine there was a version of firmware
just to shut Jon up.
