AFAICT, these are great cleanups but neither of these patches is
really a functional change.  If that's true, the "avoid config space
access" should be removed from the commit log.

I dropped d878400c7d98 for now and updated my pci/pm branch with just
these two patches with updates as attached below.

Then we can rework d878400c7d98 so it disables PTM unconditionally in
pci_pm_suspend_noirq() instead of in pci_prepare_to_sleep().

Currently, or with d878400c7d98, we only call pci_prepare_to_sleep()
when (!skip_bus_pm && !state_saved && pci_power_manageable()), so if a
driver saves its own state, we won't disable PTM, which seems like a
problem.

I assume we also want to move the pci_disable_ptm() from
pci_finish_runtime_suspend() to pci_pm_runtime_suspend() to keep it
parallel with pci_pm_suspend_noirq().

Is this making sense?

commit 22b07d9ddd02 ("PCI/PTM: Update pdev->ptm_enabled to track hardware state")
Author: Rajvi Jingar <rajvi.jingar@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 30 03:49:13 2022 -0700

    PCI/PTM: Update pdev->ptm_enabled to track hardware state
    
    Update pdev->ptm_enabled to track hardware state when we disable or restore
    PTM state.
    
    No functional change intended, since 'ptm_enabled' was previously only
    tested during enumeration and pci_disable_ptm() is only used during
    suspend.

    PCI/PM: Simplify pci_pm_suspend_noirq()
    
    We always want to save the device state unless the driver has already done
    it.  Rearrange the checking in pci_pm_suspend_noirq() to make this more
    clear.  No functional change intended.
