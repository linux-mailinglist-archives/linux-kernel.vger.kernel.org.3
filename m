Excellent, that answers another question I had regarding the above.

OK, noted. Can we add these recommendations to the header files
please? And let's make it a requirement - it's easier to relax it
later than the other way around.

Nit: use [] for flex arrays please - we will become more pedantic
about this when using newer compilers.

OK. We'll need some useful abstraction for this internally in the stub
code, but that is not too relevant for this discussion. (We recently
added some code that measures the initrd into the TPM, and having
calls to two different kinds of measurement APIs all over the stub is
something I'd like to avoid)

You mean the x86 specific struct bootparams, right? Not relevant, but
just out of interest: I take it you are also measuring the setup_data
linked list? This is currently being augmented to carry a RNG seed,
which may cause problems for you in the future.

Hmm, ok. I'd really like to get a peek at the impact on the code - if
we will have hooks all over the place, it is a strong indication that
you are intercepting this at the wrong level. Perhaps you'll need to
do something along the lines of interposing the boot and runtime
services, and measuring the invocations that are relevant to you.
