Let's see if I understand this correctly:

You want the guest to know if the its own SEV VM policy allows
debugging.  And that flag has to be trusted -- so passed from the Guest
Owner in a secure channel (otherwise the host could set it to
ALLOW_DEBUGGING even though the Guest Owner didn't approve that).

Maybe you could do that, but that will unify things that are not the
same, so I think it is the wrong approach here.

The SNP secrets are secrets generated by the AMD-SP and allow the guest
to communicate with the PSP.  There are exactly 4 of them (if I remember
correctly) and they are only AES-256-GCM keys (if I remember correctly).

On the other hand, the SEV launch secrets (which this series is about)
are secrets populated by the Guest Owner and are intended for the proper
operation of the applications in the guest (example use cases: luks
passphrase, secret API keys, file decryption keys, encrypted container
images keys, ...).

The SEV launch secrets area can also be read by grub [1], for example,
to fetch a luks passphrase from there (instead of from keyboard).
That's why its structure is generic.

I think Guest Owner can add a 1-byte predefined secret to the SEV secret
table, let's say an entry with GUID 2b91a212-b0e1-4816-b021-1e9991ddb6af
and value "\x01" to indicate debugging is allowed.

With the efi_secrets module, a 1-byte file called
/sys/kernel/security/secrets/coco/2b91a212-b0e1-4816-b021-1e9991ddb6af
will appear with "\x01" in its content.

This can indicate to the guest that debugging was permitted by the Guest
Owner.

If you want this unified in the kernel, maybe we can look for this entry
and set the relevant kernel variable.
