I think that people have given up on ACPI on Snapdragon, as it was not
providing enough information in some cases (such as TLMM pins that are
not accessible from the AP due to being marked 'secure') that needed to
be hardcoded.

New WoA laptop support is added using FDT and I haven't seen any patches
even adding ACPI matchlists for a long long time.
