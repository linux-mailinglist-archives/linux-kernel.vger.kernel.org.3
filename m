Dear kernel-driver developers,

I believe there is a mistake in calculation of the fine part of the 
temperature value as received from 1-Wire DS18x20-family sensors.

The current implementation does indeed follow the official datasheet, 
but exactly the datasheet seems to be incorrect in this place.

Datasheet: https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18S20.pdf
says two different things on Page 6:

- First:
"Resolutions greater than 9 bits can be calculated using the data from 
the temperature, COUNT REMAIN and COUNT PER 째C registers in the 
scratchpad. Note that the COUNT PER  째C  register  is  hard-wired  to 
16  (10h).  After  reading  the  scratchpad,  the  TEMP_READ  value  is 
obtained  by  truncating  the  0.5째C  bit  (bit  0)  from  the 
temperature  data  (see Figure  4)."

- And then:
"The  extended  resolution  temperature  can  then be calculated using 
the following equation:
TEMPERATURE = TEMP_READ - 0.25 + (COUNT_PER_C - COUNT_REMAIN) / COUNT_PER_C"

I have performed live tests with DS18S20 sensors to verify it, how they 
behave. I was lowering the temperature in slow steps to see individual 
transitions. Below is the result.

Columns:
- 00, 01, 06, 07 = response bytes 0 (value), 1 (sign), 6 (count remain) 
and 7 (count per degC)
- 01-bin = response byte 0 again as binary
- 7-min-6 = response byte 7 minus response byte 6
- -0- = bits 7..1 of response byte 0
- -76- = bits 3..0 of the (byte 7 - byte 6 subtraction)
- hex = the value as hex
- degreesC = the value multiplied by 1/16째C

My findings are confirmed by other people, e.g. here:
https://www.electro-tech-online.com/threads/expanding-ds18s20-output-from-9-bit-to-12-bit.128569/post-1070629

The only unclear thing for me is the byte[7]. The datasheet says it is 
hard wired to 10h. The guy here says, he has seen devices with other 
dividers:
https://www.electro-tech-online.com/threads/expanding-ds18s20-output-from-9-bit-to-12-bit.128569/post-1084824
"I noticed that the count divisor was not equal to 16 as the data sheet 
indicated it would be. In fact, as the temperature was raised and 
lowered, the count divisor would increase and decrease in value (not 
fixed)."

Assuming the guy did not make any mistake, it would be interesting to 
know, whether the divisor is always a power of 2 (which would make the 
conversion easy) or can be of any value.

For your info: I have contacted Evgeniy P. as an author of the driver, 
but according to the response, he is not maintaining the driver anymore. 
That's why a question to all of you, if anyone could take a look at this 
please.

Thank you very much and best regards
K.
